      <div class="read">
        <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web-based applications in a
          way that makes them usable and accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This includes
          ensuring that web content can be easily understood, navigated, and interacted with by people with a wide range
          of abilities and disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

        <p>This Eppi Mapper generated map conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">W3C WCAG</a>) Version
          2.1 Level AA to the maximum extent possible. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible
          for people with disabilities. The features in this map include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the default settings have been used when generating this map, the overall colour design has been set to
            a more visually contrasting appearance.</li>
          <li>Links in the application have been converted to buttons to accommodate screen readers.</li>
          <li>Aria status updates now inform screen readers when modals open and selected records change.</li>
          <li>Tab focus is contained within opened modals.</li>
          <li>The style selection functionality has been moved to the top menu for easier access.</li>
          <li>A new style, Textual view, has been added to the map. This view presents the record counts within each
            node in a text readable format.</li>
          <li>URL links for individual records have been made descriptive.</li>
          <li>The map generation tool will inform the user if the selected background and font colour contrast meet
            accessibility requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
        <p>At the present time, while the keyboard focus does stay within each opened modal, the focus cannot be moved
          to individual checkboxes or radio buttons or, in the View Records modal, to all fields in the full record.
          This means that those items, along with the nodes in the map, can only be selected using a mouse or pointing
          device. In future updates we hope to address this limitation.</p>

Although orthopedic-related incidence of postoperative ileus is about 10%, these studies are limited to spine surgery and pelvic surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate prevalence of POI and to analyze effect of chewing gum on POI and bowel function in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery.A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Gyeongsang National University Hospital. Elderly patients with hip fracture who underwent surgery from March 2017 to June 2018 were eligible to participate. Patients were excluded if they had a mastication disability, impaired cognitive function, previous history of gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease and low oxygen saturation, hip arthroplasty with causes other than hip fractures, acetabular fractures, periprosthetic fractures, or pathological fractures. Patients with consciousness problem by excessive anesthesia were also excluded. Patients were classified into 2 groups by randomization. Group I received sugar-free gum and were encouraged to chew 6 hours following surgery until the first intestinal gas is released. Group II was given the same postoperative procedure and encouraged to consume water after 6 hours.After applying exclusion criteria, 74 patients were finally included.

We conducted this trial to evaluate the preoperative chewing gums' effect for two or 4 min on POST after ETI. Patients and methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 150 female cases aged from 21 to 65 years old planned for elective breast surgery under general anesthesia. Cases were randomly distributed into three equal groups. Patients chewed one piece of sugar-free herbal gum for 2 min in Group G2 and for 4 min in Group G4 then spat it out. Group C: patients swallowed two times only before surgery. Results: One case in group G2, and two cases in group G4, and in group C dropped out. The numeric rating scale (NRS) was significantly lower in group G2 and group G4 than in group C with no difference between group G2 and group G4 at 2, 6, and 24h. Incidence of moderate/severe POST was significantly lower in both G2(16.33%) and G4 (10.42%) groups than in group C (54.17%), with no significant difference between group G2 and G4. Cough was significantly lower in group G2 (8.16%) and group G4(4.17%) than in group C (22.92%), with no significant difference between groups G2 and G4. Hoarseness of voice was comparable among the studied groups. Conclusion: Preoperative gum chewing can efficiently decrease the incidence of POST following ETI. Chewing gum for 2 min is non-inferior to chewing gum for 4 min to decrease POST incidence.","Comments":"2023-02-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdelgalil A S; Abdelrahman A S; Hassan M E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.tacc.2023.101216","Keywords":"morphine\r\nondansetron\r\nparacetamol\r\nadult\r\naged\r\narticle\r\nbreast surgery\r\ncase report\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\nendotracheal intubation\r\nfemale\r\ngeneral anesthesia\r\nhoarseness\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\nmastication\r\nnumeric rating scale\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\npreoperative care\r\npreoperative evaluation\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsore throat","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdelgalil A S, Abdelrahman A S, and Hassan M E (2023) Preoperative gum chewing for different durations to prevent postoperative sore throat after endotracheal intubation: A randomized controlled trial.

The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of acute ingestion of caffeinated chewing gum on repeated sprint performance (RSP) in team sport athletes, and whether habitual caffeine consumption alters the ergogenic effect, if any, on RSP. A total of 18 male team sport athletes undertook four RSP trials using a 40-m maximum shuttle run test, which incorporates 10 × 40-m sprints with 30 s between the start of each sprint. Each participant completed two familiarization sessions, followed by caffeine (CAF; caffeinated chewing gum; 200 mg caffeine) and placebo (PLA; noncaffeinated chewing gum) trials in a randomized, double-blind manner. RSP, assessed by sprint performance decrement (%), did not differ (p =.209; effect size = 0.16; N = 18) between CAF (5.00 ± 2.84%) and PLA (5.43 ± 2.68%). Secondary analysis revealed that low habitual caffeine consumers (&lt;40 mg/day, n = 10) experienced an attenuation of sprint performance decrement during CAF relative to PLA (5.53 ± 3.12% vs. 6.53 ± 2.91%, respectively; p =.049; effect size =0.33); an effect not observed in moderate/high habitual caffeine consumers (&gt;130 mg/day, n = 6; 3.98 ± 2.57% vs. 3.80 ± 1.79%, respectively; p =.684; effect size = 0.08). The data suggest that a low dose of caffeine in the form of caffeinated chewing gum attenuates the sprint performance decrement during RSP by team sport athletes with low, but not moderate-to-high, habitual consumption of caffeine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Evans Mark; Tierney Peter; Gray Nicola; Hawe Greg; Macken Maria; Egan Brendan; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/ijsnem.2017-0217","Keywords":"Food Intake\r\nChewing Gum Pharmacodynamics\r\nCaffeine Pharmacodynamics\r\nCentral Nervous System Drug Effects\r\nSprinting\r\nAthletic Performance\r\nTeam Sports\r\nFood Habits\r\nHuman\r\nAthletes, Male\r\nMale\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nDouble-Blind Studies\r\nEffect Size\r\nMale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Evans Mark, Tierney Peter, Gray Nicola, Hawe Greg, Macken Maria, and Egan Brendan (    ) Acute Ingestion of Caffeinated Chewing Gum Improves Repeated Sprint Performance of Team Sport Athletes With Low Habitual Caffeine Consumption..

Caffeinated chewing gum is absorbed quicker through the buccal mucosa compared with capsule delivery and absorption in the gut, although total caffeine absorption over time is not different. Rapid absorption may be important in many sporting situations. Caffeinated chewing gum improved endurance cycling performance, and there is limited evidence that repeated sprint cycling and power production may also be improved. Mouth rinsing with caffeine may stimulate nerves with direct links to the brain, in addition to caffeine absorption in the mouth. However, caffeine mouth rinsing has not been shown to have significant effects on cognitive performance. Delivering caffeine with mouth rinsing improved short-duration, high-intensity, repeated sprinting in normal and depleted glycogen states, while the majority of the literature indicates no ergogenic effect on aerobic exercise performance, and resistance exercise has not been adequately studied. Studies with caffeinated energy drinks have generally not examined the individual effects of caffeine on performance, making conclusions about this form of caffeine delivery impossible. Caffeinated aerosol mouth and nasal sprays may stimulate nerves with direct brain connections and enter the blood via mucosal and pulmonary absorption, although little support exists for caffeine delivered in this manner. Overall, more research is needed examining alternate forms of caffeine delivery including direct measures of brain activation and entry of caffeine into the blood, as well as more studies examining trained athletes and female subjects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wickham Kate A; Spriet Lawrence L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40279-017-0848-2","Keywords":"Caffeine Administration and Dosage\r\nAthletic Performance\r\nCaffeine Pharmacokinetics\r\nCaffeine Pharmacodynamics\r\nChewing Gum\r\nMouthwashes\r\nErgogenic Products\r\nPhysical Endurance\r\nExercise Intensity\r\nAnaerobic Exercises\r\nAerosols\r\nAdministration, Intranasal\r\nBrain Drug Effects\r\nGels\r\nFood, Formulated\r\nCycling\r\nCognition\r\nAerobic Exercises\r\nResistance Training\r\nEnergy Drinks\r\nSports Nutritional Sciences","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wickham Kate A, and Spriet Lawrence L (    ) Administration of Caffeine in Alternate Forms..

Objectives: The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of preoperative chewing gum and pericardial P6 acupressure point application in reduction of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Secondary objective was to assess the anxiety and satisfaction scores of the patients in the study. Materials and Methods: In this Quasi experimental study, 3 groups of 62 patients each, with intact mental status in the age group of 18-60 years of either gender posted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia, after obtaining written informed consent were included in the study. Group 1 patients received standard treatment, group 2 patients received standard treatment plus Wrigley’s extra sugar free chewing gum, group 3 patients received standard treatment plus bilateral p6 point acupressure by pressure right drug free single use pressure sensitive wrist strip.\" Patients were assessed for anxiety in preoperative period, before and after the intervention. In postoperative period patients were assessed for nausea and vomiting, requirement of rescue antiemetic and patient satisfaction. The Chi-square test or Fischer’s exact test, as applicable was employed to compare the postoperative incidence of nausea and vomiting. Results: Highly significant decrease in Amsterdam anxiety score in chewing gum group (p<0.001), followed by significant decrease in acupressure group (p=0.005). No significant change in nausea in all the groups, but in context of vomiting, both chewing gum and acupressure showed significant decrease in number of episodes in first 6 hrs (p=0.013). For rescue antiemetics in nausea, there was no significant variance in usage among the groups. However, for vomiting, a substantial decrease was found. Group 2 required significantly less (p=0.001) amount of antiemetics followed by group 3. The patients in the chewing gum group scored more in the satisfaction scoring index and this was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.010). Conclusion: Both chewing gum and acupressure reduced nausea and vomiting and the need for rescue antiemetics.

METHODOLOGY: Randomized clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, Karachi from January 2013 to January 2016. Total 218 participants, who were planned for Cesarean section, were randomly allocated into two groups, 109 participants in each group. In Group-I, patient’s received chewing gum as routine and group II was control group. Data of all subjects were analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 22.68±6.31 years. There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of age, Body Mass index, duration of surgery, parity, number of miscarriages and type of cesarean section whether elective or emergency. Significant reduction was found in terms of onset of defecation (P<0.001), onset of first flatus passed (P<0.001) and feeling of hunger (P<0.003) between two groups. CONCLUSION: The current study identified that routine use of chewing gum as postoperative order impacts positively on time of passing flatus, defecation, and feeling of hunger. Eventually, it will reduce suffering resulting from ileus fostering early feeding. Since it is non-expensive and easy to use method therefore, it can be included as a routine post-operative management for women undergoing cesarean section.

Four studies (two experiments and two intervention studies) examined the robustness of and mechanisms for these effects. Study 1 investigated the acute effect of gum on mood in the absence of task performance. Study 2 examined the effect of rate and force of chewing on mood and attention performance. Study 3 assessed the effects of chewing gum during one working day on well-being and performance, as well as postwork mood and cognitive performance. In Study 4, performance and well-being were reported throughout the workday and at the end of the day, and heart rate and cortisol were measured. Under experimental conditions, gum was associated with higher alertness regardless of whether performance tasks were completed and altered sustained attention. Rate of chewing and subjective force of chewing did not alter mood but had some limited effects on attention. Chewing gum during the workday was associated with higher productivity and fewer cognitive problems, raised cortisol levels in the morning, and did not affect heart rate. The results emphasise that chewing gum can attenuate reductions in alertness, suggesting that chewing gum enhances worker performance. © 2015 Andrew P. Allen and Andrew P.

Background: Thirst is a common and troublesome symptom of chronic heart failure. Despite the burden and prevalence of this symptom, there are limited strategies to assist in its management. Design: This is a review of literature on the burden of thirst, contributors to thirst and potential management strategies of thirst in patients with chronic heart failure. Methods: Medline, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health, PubMed and Scopus were searched using the key words thirst, chronic heart failure, angiotensin II, fluid restriction and intervention. Of the 165 citations yielded, nine studies (n = 9) were included. The eligibility criteria included participants with confirmed diagnosis of chronic heart failure, randomised controlled studies or any studies with thirst as primary or secondary outcome, in humans and in English. There was no limit to the years searched. Results: Factors related to thirst in chronic heart failure were condition; prolonged neurohormonal activation, treatment; pharmacological interventions and fluid restriction and emotion. No intervention studies were found in chronic heart failure patients. Interventions such as artificial saliva and chewing gum have been investigated for their effectiveness as a thirst reliever in haemodialysis patients. Conclusion: Thirst is a frequent and troublesome symptom for individuals with chronic heart failure. It is highly likely that this contributes to poor adherence with fluid restrictions. Chewing gum can help alleviate thirst, but investigation in people with heart failure is needed. Relevance to clinical practice: Increasing awareness of thirst and interventions to relieve it in clinical practice is likely to improve the quality of care for people with chronic heart failure. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Allida S M; Inglis S C; Davidson P M; Lal S; Hayward C S; Newton P J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Allida S M, Inglis S C, Davidson P M, Lal S, Hayward C S, and Newton P J (2015) Thirst in chronic heart failure: A review.

Methods: Women aged between 20 and 35 years scheduled for planned CD; either first or repeated, with term, singleton, viable and healthy pregnancy at obstetrics and gynecology department, Armed Forces Hospital Southern Region, Khamis Mushayt, Saudi Arabia were invited to participate and randomized if eligible into three groups. The first group chewed sugar-free gum 2 h after recovery at least for half an hour and at 2-h interval during daytime. The second group received oral fluids 6 h postoperatively, while the third group was the control group. The primary outcome measure was the time to first passage of stool. The secondary outcomes included the time of the first passage of flatus, the first hearing of normal intestinal sounds, the duration of hospital stay the duration of parenteral therapy by intravenous fluids, the time of initiating breast-feeding and the cost of hospital stay. The study was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02386748). Results: The study included 372 women randomized into three groups (124 women in each group). Chewing gum significantly improved intestinal recovery with faster onset of bowel movements, first audible intestinal sounds, passage of flatus and passage of stool (p =.0001). It was associated with significantly shorter duration of hospital stay and parenteral therapy duration (p =.0001). Abdominal distension, vomiting and ileus postoperatively were significantly higher in nonchewing gum groups. Neither paralytic ileus nor side effects were recorded with gum use.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify the difference of bowel sound return time between groups of intervention and control after being given chewing gum intervention among post-laparotomy surgery patients. Methods: This quasi-experimental study used post-test only control group design. Thirty respondents were selected by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected through observation by calculating the bowel sound return time among post laparotomy surgery patients in the intervention group (n=15) and control group (n=15), and were analyzed using the Mann Whitney test. The intervention group was asked to chew the gum once for 30 minutes, and bowel sound was measured every 30 minutes for 120 minutes. Results: The results showed that bowel sound return time in the intervention group was 90 minutes and the control group was 150 minutes, and p-value was 0.005.

One non-pharmacological intervention that has shown promising results in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus is chewing gum after surgery. However, this has not been investigated in upper gastrointestinal surgery such as pancreatic surgery. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chewing gum treatment on patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple due to pancreatic or periampullary cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted as a phase III trial that was terminated early. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic tumours scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple were included. The treatment group received chewing gum postoperatively and standard care. Controls received glucose solution and standard care. Chewing gum and glucose were used four times a day during the whole hospital stay. Time to first flatus and stool was defined as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was start with clear liquids, start with liquid diet and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences could be observed between the chewing gum intervention group and the control group. However, a numerical difference in mean time was observed in first flatus, first stool, start of clear fluids, and start of liquid diet and length of hospital stay in favour of the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study did not find statistically significant differences favouring the use of chewing gum for postoperative ileus, a positive trend was observed of a reduction of the impact of postoperative ileus among patients after pancreatic surgery. It also contributes valuable methodological experience that is important for future studies of chewing gum interventions during recovery after pancreatic surgery.

POI complicates the patient’s recovery and prolongs the stay period at the hospital. One of the most common interventions to prevent POI is early-postoperative feeding (EPF) to stimulate gastrointestinal motility that will prevent POI. Still, EPF is considered to be unsafe, according to several studies. Because of the disadvantage of EPF, some studies seek an alternative to EPF, one of which is postoperative chewing gum. The study aims to test the effectiveness of chewing gum to stimulate gastrointestinal motility in postoperative patients of PKU Muhammadiyah Gamping Hospital. Methods: The research utilized a quasi-experimental design with the post-test control group. The research’s samples are 30 postoperative patients of PKU Muhammadiyah Gamping Hospital. Samples were taken with probability sampling technique with purposive sampling approach. The effectiveness of chewing gum to stimulate gastrointestinal motility was determined by comparing the time record of the first bowel sound heard between the intervention and the control groups. Results: The result shows that there is a significance of chewing gum intervention to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. The Meantime of the first bowel sound heard of the intervention group (2.00 ± 0.07) is shorter than the control group (2.36 ± 0.33). Comparison between the intervention and control groups shows significance with p-value = 0.02 (p<0.05 indicates importance).

Chewing movement of jaw stimulates memory parts of brain by increasing blood flow and glucose delivery. Taste and odour of mint is also known to stimulate memory areas of the brain. The synergistic effect of chewing and flavour is expected to have a greater effect on cognition than chewing alone. Aim: To assess the effect of use of mint flavoured, flavourless and absence of chewing gum on an individual's cognitive function among the medical undergraduates. Materials and Methods: This comparative, interventional study, was conducted in the Department of Physiology at Velammal Medical College and Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, August 2019 to September 2019. Study involved 75 (39 females,36 males) MBBS first year students, aged 18-20 years. Only students with cognitive score between 28-30 based on Mini-mental state exam score were included in the study and were divided into 3 groups. Group A (n=25) who were given mint flavoured chewing gum, Group B (n=25) given flavourless chewing gum and Group C (n=25) the control group, not provided with chewing gum. Baseline memory, Heart Rate (HR), Reaction Time (RT) and Stress Levels (SL) were recorded. Groups were taken into separate rooms where they were allowed to study a particular topic i.e Parkinson's disease for 30 minutes. Then they were allowed to take tests on standard Parkinson's questionnaire for 20 minutes and assessed based on the test performance. Group A and Group B were provided with chewing gums both during studying the topic as well as taking tests. Post intervention test performance (short term memory), HR, RT and SL were again recorded. Test performance was also assessed after one month to assess the effect of chewing gum on long term memory. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were used to compare all the post test parameters between the three groups. Results: A statistically significant increase in short term memory (p-value=0.001) and HR (p-value=0.001) were observed after intervention. Similarly, short term memory level of the three groups subjects statistically differed (p-value=0.001). When considering the reaction time (p-value=0.068) and stress level (p-value=0.927), there was no significant difference among the three groups after the intervention. Assessment of the test scores alone after one month (long term memory) showed a significantly higher score (p-value<0.001) in Group A when compared with the other two groups. C onclusion: Mint flavoured chewing gum improves cognition as evidenced by improvement in test scores, alertness and attention. The performance in the flavour less chewing gum group was lesser than mint flavoured group, but significantly better than control group.","Comments":"2022-06-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Anu S; Jeyashree K; Vishnuvavarthini S N; Venkatesh N P; Anto J V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7860/JCDR/2022/53795.16435","Keywords":"pulse oximeter\r\nmenthol\r\nadult\r\nalertness\r\nanalysis of variance\r\narticle\r\nattention\r\nchewing gum\r\ncognition\r\ncomparative study\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nheart rate\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nintervention study\r\nLamiaceae\r\nlong term memory\r\nmale\r\nmedical school\r\nmemory\r\nMini Mental State Examination\r\nParkinson disease\r\nphysiological stress\r\nquestionnaire\r\nreaction time\r\nscoring system\r\nshort term memory\r\nTamil Nadu\r\ntask performance\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Anu S, Jeyashree K, Vishnuvavarthini S N, Venkatesh N P, and Anto J V (2022) Effect of Mint Flavoured Chewing Gum in Observing Changes in Cognitive Function while Assessing Test Performance-An Interventional Study.

FINDINGS: Of the 3,497 articles found, 987 unique articles were considered. After title and abstract reviews, 977 articles were excluded, leaving 52 randomized controlled trials for examination. Common interventions included chewing gum, early hydration, acupuncture, and coffee consumption. Compared to control groups, intervention groups had quicker bowel function return, shorter hospital stays, fewer complications, and enhanced quality of life. CONCLUSION: Nondrug nursing interventions post colorectal surgery can effectively mitigate POI, optimize bowel function, and boost patient satisfaction, warranting their incorporation into post-surgery care protocols.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arslan H N; Çelik S Ş; Bozkul G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jopan.2024.03.012","Keywords":"acupuncture\r\nadult\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee consumption\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ncomplication\r\ndrug therapy\r\nhuman\r\nhydration\r\nintestine function\r\nmeta analysis\r\nnursing intervention\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nprevention\r\nquality of life\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nreview\r\nsurgery\r\nsurgical patient\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arslan H N, Çelik S Ş, and Bozkul G (2024) Postoperative Ileus and Nonpharmacological Nursing Interventions for Colorectal Surgery: A Systematic Review.

Even though this condition is experienced intensively in surgical patients, it is still not listed in the nursing diagnoses classification and there is no standard for quenching thirst. AIM: The study was conducted to determine effect of frozen saline and menthol gum on thirst level after abdominal surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This mixed-methods study was conducted between March 2020 and July 2021. A power analysis determined the inclusion of 159 patients. Quantitative data were collected using the Patient Information Form, FOUR Score, Safe Protocol for Early Postoperative Thirst Management, and Numerical Rating Scale. The qualitative stage involved a descriptive study design, with four open-ended questions informed by the literature. After gathering quantitative data, patients were interviewed by phone, and the qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Patients' thirst level in the frozen saline and menthol gum group was lower than the control group at all time (Cohen's d = .217, 95% confidence interval 5.43 to 6.35; p = 0.000). In the qualitative stage, three main themes emerged: thirst experience, post-application opinions and feelings. After the interventions, patients reported that they felt well intensely. CONCLUSIONS: Frozen saline and menthol gum were found to be effective in quenching thirst after abdominal surgery. The patients in the experimental groups expressed their opinions about feeling well after the applications, and the majority of the patients stated that they wanted the application to be repeated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite several attempts to quench thirst, thirst still remains a significant problem in intensive care units. It is felt more commonly and intensely, especially in surgical intensive care patients. However, it is a symptom that is not taken into consideration enough. For this reason, intensive care nurses need to increase their focus on issues of thirst.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aslan B; Özkan M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/nicc.13288","Keywords":"menthol\r\nsodium chloride\r\nabdomen\r\naged\r\nchewing gum\r\ndrug effect\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\nqualitative research\r\nsurgery\r\nthirst","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aslan B, and Özkan M (2025) Effect of frozen saline and menthol gum on thirst level after abdominal surgery: A mixed-methods study.

This open-label balanced-group randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate whether the chewing of sugar-free gum caused an increased volume or reduced pH of residual gastric fluid in fasting patients. For this study 212 patients undergoing elective gastroscopy were randomised into a control group who followed routine fasting instructions and an intervention group who were asked to chew gum while fasting. Residual gastric fluid was aspirated under direct vision via a gastroscope under anaesthesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of a gastric residual volume &gt;50 ml in participants who chewed gum compared with a control group. Secondary outcomes were variability in the overall gastric volume distribution and gastric pH distribution between the two groups. Nine out of 110 (8.2%) in the chewing gum group and six out of 102 (5.9%) in the control group had a residual gastric fluid volume &gt;50 ml: incidence rate ratio 1.39 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.51-3.77; P=0.60). However, only one patient (in the control group) had a residual gastric volume &gt;73 ml. There was no statistically significant difference in gastric volume distribution between groups, odds ratio 1.60 (95% CI 0.99-2.58; P=0.054) or in the distribution of gastric pH measurement, odds ratio 0.90 (95% CI 0.57-1.44; P=0.67). These results indicate that if there is an increase in the incidence of residual gastric volume &gt;50 ml in patients who chew gum preoperatively, it is likely to be small. Moreover, the absence of any patients in our chewing gum group with a residual gastric volume &gt;73 ml is reassuring.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Best Gregg W.

The primary aim of this trial was to determine whether chewing gum reduces length of hospital stay (LOS) after colorectal resection. Secondary aims included examining bowel habit symptoms, complications and healthcare costs. Methods: This clinical trial allocated patients randomly to standard postoperative care with or without chewing gum (sugar-free gum for at least 10 min, four times per day on days 1-5) in five UK hospitals. The primary outcome was LOS. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for LOS. Results: Data from 402 of 412 patients, of whom 199 (49·5 per cent) were allocated to chewing gum, were available for analysis. Some 40 per cent of patients in both groups had laparoscopic surgery, and all study sites used enhanced recovery programmes. Median (i.q.r.) LOS was 7 (5-11) days in both groups (P = 0·962); the hazard ratio for use of gum was 0·94 (95 per cent c.i. 0·77 to 1·15; P = 0·557). Participants allocated to gum had worse quality of life, measured using the EuroQoL 5D-3L, than controls at 6 and 12 weeks after operation (but not on day 4). They also had more complications graded III or above according to the Dindo-Demartines-Clavien classification (16 versus 6 in the group that received standard care) and deaths (11 versus 0), but none was classed as related to gum. No other differences were observed. Conclusion: Chewing gum did not alter the return of bowel function or LOS after colorectal resection.

There are limitations and concerns over its treatment with antibiotics and surgery and so effective preventative measures are attractive. A potential preventative measure is xylitol, a natural sugar substitute that reduces the risk of dental decay. Xylitol can reduce the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae)andHaemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of xylitol to prevent AOM in children aged up to 12 years. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (to Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2016), Embase (1974 to January 2016), CINAHL (1981 to January 2016), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), Web of Science (2011 to January 2016) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2000 to January 2016). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of children aged 12 years or younger where xylitol supplementation was compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent AOM. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials from search results, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion in the review. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. We noted data on any adverse events of xylitol. We extracted data on relevant outcomes and estimated the effect size by calculating risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children for inclusion. For this 2016 update, we identified one new trial for inclusion. This trial was systematically reviewed but due to several sources of heterogeneity, was not included in the meta-analysis. The remaining four trials were of adequate methodological quality. In three RCTs that involved a total of 1826 healthy Finnish children attending daycare, there is moderate quality evidence that xylitol (in any form) can reduce the risk of AOM from 30% to around 22% compared with the control group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88). Among the reasons for dropouts, there were no significant differences in abdominal discomfort and rash between the xylitol and the control groups. Xylitol was not effective in reducing AOM among healthy children during a respiratory infection (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; moderate quality evidence) or among otitis-prone healthy children (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21; low-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: There is moderate quality evidence showing that the prophylactic administration of xylitol among healthy children attending daycare centres can reduce the occurrence of AOM. There is inconclusive evidence with regard to the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM among children with respiratory infection, or among otitis-prone children. The meta-analysis was limited because data came from a small number of studies, and most were from the same research group.","Comments":"2016-08-23","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Azarpazhooh A; Lawrence H P; Shah P S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD007095.pub3","Keywords":"xylitol\r\nabdominal discomfort\r\nacute otitis media\r\nchewing gum\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\nFinland\r\nhuman\r\nlozenge\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrash\r\nrespiratory tract infection\r\nreview\r\nrisk reduction\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Azarpazhooh A, Lawrence H P, and Shah P S (2016) Xylitol for preventing acute otitis media in children up to 12 years of age.

Evidence acquisition A comprehensive systematic MEDLINE search was performed for English language reports published before May 2015 using the terms “postoperative period,” “postoperative care,” “enhanced recovery after surgery,” “enhanced recovery,” “accelerated recovery,” “fast track recovery,” “recovery program,” “recovery pathway”, “ERAS,” and “urology” or “cystectomy” or “urologic surgery.” Evidence synthesis We identified 18 eligible articles. Patient counseling, physical conditioning, avoiding excessive alcohol and smoking, and good nutrition appeared to protect against postoperative complications. Fasting from solid food for only 6 h and perioperative liquid–carbohydrate loading up to 2 h prior to surgery appeared to be safe and reduced recovery times. Restricted, balanced, and goal-directed fluid replacement is effective when individualized, depending on patient morbidity and surgical procedure. Decreased intraoperative blood loss may be achieved by several measures. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, and thermoregulation were found to help reduce postsurgical complications, as was a multimodal approach to postoperative nausea, vomiting, and analgesia. Chewing gum, prokinetic agents, oral laxatives, and an early resumption to normal diet appear to aid faster return to normal bowel function. Further studies should compare anesthetic protocols, refine analgesia, and evaluate the importance of robot-assisted surgery and the need/timing for drains and catheters. Conclusions ERAS regimens are multidisciplinary, multimodal pathways that optimize postoperative recovery. Patient summary This review provides an overview of the use and key elements of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery programs, which are multimodal, multidisciplinary care pathways that aim to optimize postoperative recovery. Additional conclusions include identifying effective procedures within Enhanced Recovery after Surgery programs and defining needs for future clinical trials.","Comments":"2016-07-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Azhar R A; Bochner B; Catto J; Goh A C; Kelly J; Patel H D; Pruthi R S; Thalmann G N; Desai M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eururo.2016.02.051","Keywords":"laxative\r\nprokinetic agent\r\nalcohol consumption\r\nanalgesia\r\nantibiotic prophylaxis\r\ncatheter\r\nchewing gum\r\nconditioning\r\nconvalescence\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\ndeep vein thrombosis\r\ndiet restriction\r\ndrain\r\nenhanced recovery after surgery\r\nhospital discharge\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nlength of stay\r\nclinical audit\r\nnutrition\r\noperative blood loss\r\npatient counseling\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\npreoperative care\r\npriority journal\r\nprophylaxis\r\nquality of life\r\nreview\r\nrobot assisted surgery\r\nsmoking\r\nstomach intubation\r\nsurgical drainage\r\nsystematic review\r\nthermoregulation\r\nurologic surgery","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Azhar R A, Bochner B, Catto J, Goh A C, Kelly J, Patel H D, Pruthi R S, Thalmann G N, and Desai M (2016) Enhanced Recovery after Urological Surgery: A Contemporary Systematic Review of Outcomes, Key Elements, and Research Needs.

However, there is paucity of literature on the labour pain experience and perceptions about labour pain with the contemporary Ghanaian health system. Therefore this study sought to gain an in-depth understanding on labour pain experiences and perceptions of post-partum women. Methods: The study adopted an exploratory descriptive qualitative approach and collected data through individual interviews. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants who were purposively sampled. After transcription of interviews, the data were analyzed inductively using content analysis techniques. Results: Women in this study experienced pain during labour rated as mild, moderate and severe and the pain was felt at the waist area, vagina, lower abdomen and the general body. The women expressed labour pain through crying, screaming and shouting. They prayed to God to help reduce the severe pain. Some women endured the pain, cried inwardly and others showed no sign of pain. Some women believed that crying during labour is a sign of weakness. Pain reliefs such as pethidine (Meperidine) was occasionally given. Non-pharmacologic measures employed included walking around, deep breathing, side-lying, waist holding, squatting, taking a shower and chewing gum. The individuality of pain experience and expression was emphasized and the socio-cultural orientation of women made some of them stoic. Conclusion: We concluded that it is necessary for all health professionals to manage labour pain effectively taking the socio-cultural context into consideration.","Comments":"2017-03-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aziato L; Acheampong A K; Umoar K L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12884-017-1248-1","Keywords":"pethidine\r\nadult\r\nanalgesia\r\narticle\r\nbreathing exercise\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontent analysis\r\ncrying\r\ncultural anthropology\r\ndata analysis\r\ndescriptive research\r\nexploratory research\r\nfemale\r\nGhana\r\nhuman\r\ninformed consent\r\ninterview\r\nlabor pain\r\nlower abdominal pain\r\nmaternal attitude\r\npain severity\r\nperception\r\npuerperium\r\nqualitative research\r\nrecumbency\r\nreligion\r\nvagina pain\r\nwalking\r\nweakness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aziato L, Acheampong A K, and Umoar K L (2017) Labour pain experiences and perceptions: A qualitative study among post-partum women in Ghana.

Novel measures such as preoperative loading of oral carbohydrates and postoperative chewing gum have recently gained momentum for postoperative recovery. This study evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading and postoperative chewing gum (CG) on PONV after daycare laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS: A total of 100 patients were randomized to group A (preoperative carbohydrate loading with 200 ml of water with 25 g of carbohydrate and postoperative chewing gum (CG) when the patient responded to his/her name) and group B (standard care). The incidence of PONV and pain was assessed by using visual analogue scale. Quality of recovery (QoR-15) was assessed by using QoR15 questionnaire at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of PONV and pain was lower in group A; however, it was not significant (p > 0.05). The severity of PONV, pain and the need for rescue antiemetic was significantly lower in group A (p < 0.05). The episodes of PONV and required dose of antiemetic were less in group A. Group A also had a significantly higher QoR-15 score at all time points (p < 0.001). Preoperative dyspepsia was also noticed as a significant confounding predictor for postoperative vomiting. CONCLUSION: Preoperative carbohydrate drinks and early postoperative CG reduces the severity of PONV and requirement of antiemetics in patients undergoing LC. Hence, these simple measures can be used as a standard of care to optimize perioperative care in patients undergoing daycare surgery.","Comments":"2023-11-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balabolu M; Abuji K; Soni S L; Satish S N; Sharma A; Singh A; Behera A; Tandup C; Kaman L; Dahiya D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00268-023-07145-8","Keywords":"antiemetic agent\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nday care\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy\r\nmale\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\npostoperative pain\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balabolu M, Abuji K, Soni S L, Satish S N, Sharma A, Singh A, Behera A, Tandup C, Kaman L, and Dahiya D (2023) Effect of Preoperative Carbohydrate Drink and Postoperative Chewing Gum on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Undergoing Day Care Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

We aimed to determine the anxiolytic effects of chewing gum in pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section under regional anesthesia. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Sixty-six women were randomly assigned to either the control group (n=33) or gum group (n=33) in a 1:1 ratio. In the gum group, the participants chewed xylitol gum for at least 10 min/h, regardless of fasting. Gum chewing was started at 5 pm a day before surgery and continued till the participant entered the operation room. In the control group, participants were requested to follow fasting guidelines without further instruction. The primary outcome was preoperative anxiety measured using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) immediately before surgery. RESULTS: The APAIS score immediately before surgery showed no significant difference between the control and the gum group (19.2±5.8 vs. 19.1±4.1, P>0.99). There were no statistically significant differences in the eight items related to anxiety: unfitness, concentration difficulty, hunger, thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, and nausea. However, the pain score during the procedure of combined spinal epidural anesthesia was significantly lower in the chewing gum group [4 (IQR, 3-5.5)] than in the control group [5 (IQR, 3-7), P=0.045]. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative gum chewing did not reduce anxiety levels measured immediately before entering the operating room in the participants undergoing elective cesarean section.

Although clinical benefits of preoperative oral carbohydrate is well reported, the effect of adding chewing gum to carbohydrate loading has never been studied. We aimed to investigate the effect of adding gum-chewing to oral carbohydrates on preoperative anxiety and gastric volume in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. Methods One hundred and four patients were enrolled and randomized either into a carbohydrate drink group (CHD group) or CHD with gum group. The CHD group was instructed to drink 400 mL of oral carbohydrate the evening before and 200-400 mL 3 hours before surgery. The CHD with gum group was encouraged to chew gum freely during preanesthetic fasting in addition to consuming oral carbohydrates in the same manner. The primary endpoint was preoperative anxiety assessed using the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS). The degree of patient-reported quality of recovery after surgery and gastric volume prior to general anesthesia were also compared as secondary outcomes. Results Preoperative APAIS was lower in the CHD with gum group compared with the CHD group (16 [11.5, 20] vs. 20 [16.5, 23], p = 0.008). Patient-rated quality of recovery after surgery was also higher in the CHD with gum group and showed a significant negative correlation with preoperative APAIS score (correlation coefficient: -0.950, p = 0.001). Gastric volume were not different between the groups (0 [0-0.45] vs. 0 [0-0.22], p = 0.158).

Experiment 1 shows that interfering with articulatory motor programming by chewing gum reduces both the number of voluntary and the number of involuntary-unwanted-musical thoughts. This is consistent with other findings that chewing gum interferes with voluntary processes such as recollections from verbal memory, the interpretation of ambiguous auditory images, and the scanning of familiar melodies, but is not predicted by theories of thought suppression, which assume that suppression is made more difficult by concurrent tasks or cognitive loads. Experiment 2 shows that chewing the gum affects the experience of \"hearing\" the music and cannot be ascribed to a general effect on thinking about a tune only in abstract terms. Experiment 3 confirms that the reduction of musical recollections by chewing gum is not the consequence of a general attentional or dual-task demand.

Gum chewing has emerged as a new and simple modality for decreasing postoperative ileus. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of chewing gum in reducing postoperative ileus in terms of passage of flatus and total length of hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted in department of surgery, Services Hospital Lahore, between November 2013 and November 2015. The patients were divided into two groups: chewing gum (Group A) and no chewing gum (Group B). Starting 6 h after the operation, Group A patients were asked to chew gum for 30 min every 8 h; bowel sounds, passage of flatus and total length of hospital stay were noted. Outcome measures such as passage of flatus and total length of hospital stay in patients undergoing reversal of ileostomy were compared using t-test. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients in Group A was 26.12 (± 7.1) years and in Group B was 28.80 (± 10.5) years. There were 25 males (50%) and 25 females (50%) in Group A. In Group B, there were 29 males (58%) and 21 females (42%). Mean BMI in Group A was 23.5 (± 5.3), and in Group B was 21.4 (± 4.6). The mean time to pass flatus was noted to be significantly shorter, 18.36 (± 8.43) hours, in the chewing group (Group A), whereas in the no chewing gum group (Group B), it was 41.16 (± 6.14) hours (p value < 0.001). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter 84 (± 8.3) hours in the chewing gum group (Group A) as compared to 107.04 (± 6.4) hours in the no chewing gum group (Group B) (p value 0.000). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that postoperative chewing of gum after the reversal of ileostomy is accompanied with a significantly shorter time to passage of flatus and shorter length of hospital stay.","Comments":"2021-07-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bhatti S; Malik Y J; Changazi S H; Rahman U A; Malik A A; Butt U I; Umar M; Farooka M W; Ayyaz M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00268-020-05897-1","Keywords":"adult\r\nadverse event\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\ngastrointestinal motility\r\nhuman\r\nileostomy\r\nileus\r\nlength of stay\r\nmale\r\npostoperative complication\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bhatti S, Malik Y J, Changazi S H, Rahman U A, Malik A A, Butt U I, Umar M, Farooka M W, and Ayyaz M (2021) Role of Chewing Gum in Reducing Postoperative Ileus after Reversal of Ileostomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Postoperative ileus is a temporary impairment of intestinal motility and a frequent complication after RC. It is characterized by abdominal distention and absence of bowel functions, with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, pain and cramps. This results in an increase in length of stay, patient discomfort and costs. Different studies investigated the efficacy of chewing gum use, as a form of simulated feeding, in accelerating the resolution of ileus after several abdominal surgical procedures. Considering the lack of specific studies, some other conducted in similar abdominal procedures were included in this literature review. Despite the diversity of type of surgery, all considered studies show for patients who received chewing gum, a significant reduction in the time of first flatus and faeces, a reduction in the time of first bowel movements; not all included studies instead have found a significant decreasing in morbidity and length of stay. The chewing gum use seems to be a simple and inexpensive way to enhance recovery of bowel function, although it is probably still a little known procedure. It is possible recommending the administration of chewing gum in patients after cystectomy, monitoring the effectiveness, upon the recognition of possible conditions that might contraindicate its use. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and BAUN","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Boarin M; Villa G; Di Monte V; Abbadessa F; Manara D F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Boarin M, Villa G, Di Monte V, Abbadessa F, and Manara D F (2017) The use of chewing gum for postoperative ileus prevention in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.

Purpose: The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of chewing gum on satiety, food hedonics and snack intake and to explore the potential effects of the combination of Garciniacambogia, green coffee extract and l-carnitine on satiety, when administered in a gum format. Methods: This was a prospective study in which 57 subjects randomly received three kinds of treatments, in a crossover design: (1) active gum; (2) placebo gum; and (3) no gum. Food preferences and appetite sensations were evaluated by means of the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire and visual analog scales. Results: There was a significant reduction in low-fat sweet snack intake with placebo gum and the active gum compared to no gum and a reduction in high-fat sweet snack intake with the active gum compared to placebo gum and no gum. Total caloric intake was only reduced in the active gum condition. Both the active and placebo gum conditions significantly reduced hunger and prospective food consumption and increased fullness compared to no gum and were associated with a reduced wanting for sweet food in the LFPQ, consistent in a reduction in the relative preference for sweet snacks versus savoury snacks. Conclusion: This study supports the notion that chewing gum containing nutraceutical products might aid in the control over snack intake and reduce hunger sensations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bobillo C; Finlayson G; Martínez A; Fischman D; Beneitez A; Ferrero A J; Fernández B E; Mayer M A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bobillo C, Finlayson G, Martínez A, Fischman D, Beneitez A, Ferrero A J, Fernández B E, and Mayer M A (2018) Short-term effects of a green coffee extract-, Garcinia c ambogia- and l-carnitine-containing chewing gum on snack intake and appetite regulation.

The aims of this narrative review were to provide an update of classification systems, preventive techniques, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment options for established POI. Methods: The Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using the key phrases 'ileus', 'postoperative ileus' and 'definition', for relevant studies published in English from January 1997 to August 2014. Results: POI is still a problematic and frequent complication of surgery. Fluid overload, exogenous opioids, neurohormonal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal stretch and inflammation are key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POI. Evidence is supportive of thoracic epidural analgesia, avoidance of salt and water overload, alvimopan and gum chewing as measures for the prevention of POI, and should be incorporated into perioperative care protocols. Minimal access surgery and avoidance of nasogastric tubes may also help. Novel strategies are emerging, but further studies are required for the treatment of prolonged POI, where evidence is still lacking. Conclusions: Although POI is often inevitable, methods to reduce its duration and facilitate recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function are evolving rapidly. Utilisation of standardised diagnostic classification systems will help improve applicability of future studies.","Comments":"2020-10-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bragg D; El-Sharkawy A M; Psaltis E; Maxwell-Armstrong C A; Lobo D N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2015.01.016","Keywords":"acetylcholine\r\nalvimopan\r\ncelecoxib\r\nchemokine\r\ncorticotropin releasing factor\r\ncytokine\r\ndaikenchuto\r\ndiclofenac\r\nlaxative\r\nlidocaine\r\nmagnesium oxide\r\nmagnesium sulfate\r\nmosapride\r\nneurohormone\r\nnicotine\r\nnonsteroid antiinflammatory agent\r\nopiate derivative\r\nplacebo\r\nprokinetic agent\r\nsodium chloride\r\nunclassified drug\r\nwater\r\navoidance behavior\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical feature\r\nclinical trial (topic)\r\ncoffee\r\ncontrol strategy\r\ndigestive system inflammation\r\ndisease classification\r\ndisease duration\r\nepidural anesthesia\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\nhuman\r\nhypervolemia\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nmobilization\r\nnasogastric tube\r\npathophysiology\r\nperioperative period\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nreview","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bragg D, El-Sharkawy A M, Psaltis E, Maxwell-Armstrong C A, and Lobo D N (2015) Postoperative ileus: Recent developments in pathophysiology and management.

The efficacy of GutsyGum(tm) was determined in alleviating the symptoms of GER after a refluxogenic meal compared to placebo gum. This double-blind, placebo-controlled-crossover trial with a one-week washout between treatments had 24 participants with a history of GER consume a refluxogenic meal and then chew GutsyGum(tm) or placebo gum. Participants completed GER symptom questionnaires, consisting of symptom based 10 cm Visual Analogue Scales, immediately following the meal and then at regular intervals out to four hours postmeal. Adjusted mean ± SEM heartburn score (15-min postmeal to 240 min) was significantly lower in GutsyGum(tm) than in placebo gum treatment (0.81 ± 0.20 vs. 1.45 ± 0.20 cm; p = 0.034).

The objective of this study was to assess if coffee or chewing gum can increase excretion of the colon capsule within battery life time (excretion rate). Methods: One hundred eighty six screening participants with a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test were included in this single-centre randomized controlled trial with blinding of the investigators to the randomization. Participants received instant coffee, chewing gum or nothing in addition to the standard bowel preparation. Results: The intention was to include 57 participants in the coffee group, 61 in the chewing gum group and 60 in the control group, on 8 participants data were missing. A total of 165 participants were included in a per protocol analysis. Exclusion was due to not receiving the allocated intervention (8 coffee, 4 chewing gum) and technical failure of the capsule (1 coffee). The excretion rate was 58% in the coffee group (n = 48), 63% in the chewing gum group (n = 57) and 55% in the control group (n = 60, p > 0.2). Transit times were similar in all groups. The excretion rate was low in participants who had transit times over 10 h (14%). A strong correlation was found between adequate cleansing and excretion of the capsule. There were no serious adverse events related to the interventions or CCE investigations. Conclusions: Chewing gum and coffee did not improve excretion rate in this study. An effect of chewing gum could not be proven, possibly due to sample size. Since chewing gum might improve excretion rates, is cheap and has no known side effects, it needs to be considered in future bowel preparation trials for CCE.","Comments":"2018-10-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Buijs M M; Kobaek-Larsen M; Kaalby L; Baatrup G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12876-018-0824-9","Keywords":"NCT02303756\r\ncapsule endoscope\r\nPillCam2\r\nadult\r\naged\r\narticle\r\ncapsule endoscopy\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee\r\ncolon lavage\r\ncontrolled study\r\nexcretion\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nintestine preparation\r\nintestine transit time\r\nmale\r\noccult blood\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nPillCam2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Buijs M M, Kobaek-Larsen M, Kaalby L, and Baatrup G (2018) Can coffee or chewing gum decrease transit times in Colon capsule endoscopy?

Method: This was a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing elective open or laparoscopic bowel surgery, who were allocated into two groups: a chewing gum group (CG); or a nonchewing gum group (NG). Primary outcomes were time to discharge (length of hospital stay [LOS]), time to first flatus (TFF) and time to first bowel motion (TBM). Secondary outcomes were complication rates, pain and total morphine equivalent (TMEq) medication for 7 days after the procedure. Results: Between 2010 and 2013, 162 patients were randomized; four were excluded, leaving 158 in the study (82 in the CG and 76 in the NG). There was no difference in LOS between the CG (5.8 days) and the NG (6.1 days) (P = 0.403) or in the median TFF between the CG (42.0 h) and the NG (58.0 h) (P = 0.076). The median TBM was lower in the CG (40.0 h) than in the NG (90.0 h) (P = 0.002). There was no difference in intra-operative complications between the CG (9%) and the NG (9%) (P = 0.901) or in early postoperative complications (44% for CG and 55% for NG) (P = 0.131). There was no difference in TMEq at 24 h postprocedure, but the CG had reduced TMEq from days 2 to 7 post procedure and for the 7-day total. Pain was higher among patients in the NG on day 3. Conclusion: Chewing sugar-free gum resulted in an earlier return to bowel function and decreased analgesic requirements. There was no decrease in overall LOS or postoperative complications.","Comments":"2018-05-16","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Byrne C M; Zahid A; Young J M; Solomon M J; Young C J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/codi.13930","Keywords":"morphine\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncolon injury\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nfever\r\nflatulence\r\nhospital discharge\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine injury\r\nintestine parameters\r\nintestine surgery\r\nintraoperative period\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nperoperative complication\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative hemorrhage\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative pain\r\npostoperative period\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\npulmonary sepsis\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsepsis\r\ntime to first bowel motion\r\ntime to first flatus\r\nurinary tract infection\r\nurine retention\r\nwound infection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Byrne C M, Zahid A, Young J M, Solomon M J, and Young C J (2018) Gum chewing aids bowel function return and analgesic requirements after bowel surgery: a randomized controlled trial.

Background: Caesarean operation is the most significant surgical intervention that affects central nervous system and decelerates bowel movements in the postoperative period. Conducted studies show that practices such as gum chewing ensure that bowel functions start in a short time through early feeding and mobilisation and shorten the duration of hospital stay. Design: A randomised controlled experimental was used. Method: A total of 120 women participated in the study in three groups of 40 for gum, exercise and control groups. Gum was given to the groups in the gum section two hours after the ceasarean, the women chewed gum for the first eight hours until flatulence for 15 minutes every two hours. However, the women in the exercise group started moving two hours after the caesarean for the first eight hours until flatulence for five minutes every two hours. The control group consisted of women under routine treatment and care of the hospital. All women were hourly evaluated in terms of abdominal sounds, flatulence and defaecation. Results: It was determined that following caesarean, bowel functions started in three groups at the same time, there was no significant difference between three groups. It was determined that the gum group, exercise group and the control group were discharged earlier, there was no significant difference between three groups Conclusion: The study results show that spinal anaesthesia have positive effects on discharge time after caesarean section operation.

Despite the use of various preventive strategies, PONV continues to negatively impact recovery and increase healthcare expenses. This study aimed to evaluate whether the preoperative use of sugar-free chewing gum could effectively minimize the dependence on anti-emetic drugs in women undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for uterine myomas. Methods: In this randomized, single-blind study, 92 adult women scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery were enrolled. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a gum-chewing group, which was instructed to chew sugar-free gum for 15 min in the preoperative holding area, or a control group that did not chew gum. The primary outcome was the requirement for anti-emetic medication within the first hour after surgery, when the patient was in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included the overall frequency of anti-emetic use. To assess the intervention’s effectiveness independent of any other factors, no prophylactic anti-emetics were administered during surgery. Results: Of the 92 participants, 89 completed the study, with 44 assigned to the gum-chewing group and 45 to the control group. The gum-chewing group showed a significantly lower rate of PONV, requiring anti-emetic treatment (79.5%), compared to the control group (95.6%). Additionally, the control group demonstrated a higher overall need for anti-emetic medications. Notably, there were no reported adverse effects, such as jaw discomfort, dental injuries, or gastric regurgitation, in either group. Conclusions: Chewing sugar-free gum for 15 min prior to surgery was found to be a safe, simple, and effective method to reduce the occurrence of PONV in women undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign uterine tumors. This non-invasive intervention reduced the reliance on anti-emetic drugs and improved patient comfort, without introducing risks. These findings suggest that preoperative gum chewing could be routinely implemented in clinical settings to enhance surgical outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chae M S; Koh H J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chae M S, and Koh H J (2024) Effect of Preoperative Gum Chewing on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Women Undergoing Robotic Laparoscopic Surgery for Uterine Myomas: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Despite available prophylactic measures, the incidence of PONV remains high, negatively impacting recovery and increasing healthcare costs. This study evaluates whether preoperative gum chewing reduces the need for anti-emetic drugs in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass. Materials and Methods: This prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial enrolled 92 adult females scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to treat benign ovarian mass. Following exclusions, the remaining participants were randomly assigned to either a gum-chewing group or a no-gum-chewing group. The gum-chewing group chewed sugar-free gum for 15 min in the holding area before surgery. The primary outcome measured was the need for anti-emetics to control PONV during the first hour in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included the number of anti-emetic requests. No preemptive anti-emetics were administered during surgery. Results: Out of the initial 92 patients, 88 were included in the final analysis, with 44 in each group. The incidence of PONV requiring anti-emetics in the PACU was significantly lower in the gum-chewing group (79.5%) compared to the no-gum-chewing group (95.5%). Additionally, the number of anti-emetic requests was higher in the no-gum-chewing group. No postoperative complications such as tooth or jaw pain/injury or gastric content regurgitation were reported. Conclusions: Preoperative gum chewing for 15 min immediately before surgery significantly reduced the incidence of PONV in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass. This simple, non-pharmacological intervention improved patient comfort and reduced the need for anti-emetic medications without any adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to develop guidelines for incorporating preoperative gum chewing into clinical practice.","Comments":"2024-08-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chae M S; Lee S; Choi Y J; Koh H J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/medicina60071135","Keywords":"antiemetic agent\r\nadult\r\nadverse event\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nlaparoscopy\r\nmiddle aged\r\novary tumor\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\nprevention and control\r\nprocedures\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrobot assisted surgery\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsurgery","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chae M S, Lee S, Choi Y J, and Koh H J (2024) Impact of Preoperative Gum Chewing on Postoperative Anti-Emetic Use in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Benign Ovarian Masses: A Prospective, Single-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial.

Randomized controlled trial. Objective. The present study investigated the effectiveness of chewing gum on promoting faster bowel function and its ability to hasten recovery for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery. Summary of Background Data. Sham feeding with chewing gum had been reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus by accelerating recovery of bowel function. Methods. We prospectively recruited and randomized 60 patients with AIS scheduled for PSF surgery into treatment (chewing gum) and control group. The patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth were assessed and recorded at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours postoperatively. The timing for the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up, walking, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay were also assessed and recorded. Results. We found that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth between treatment (chewing gum) and control groups. We also found that there were no significant difference (P > 0.05) in postoperative recovery parameters, which were the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up after surgery, walking after surgery, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay between both groups. The wound pain was the worst at 12 hours postoperatively, which progressively improved in both groups. The abdominal pain progressively worsened to the highest score at 48 hours in the treatment group and 36 hours in the control group before improving after that. The pattern of severity and recovery of wound pain and abdominal pain was different. Conclusion.

The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness and acceptability of 3 different forms of nicotine replacement therapy in achieving smoking reduction among acute psychiatric inpatients. Methods This cluster-randomized, parallel study compared effectiveness and acceptability of nicotine inhalers, nicotine gum, and nicotine patches for smoking reduction in the acute psychiatric inpatient setting. The primary outcome was the exhaled breath carbon monoxide (CO) level change from baseline at weeks 4 and 8. Secondary outcomes included changes in nicotine withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric symptom severity. Results Three hundred ten inpatients on the acute care wards were randomly assigned to nicotine inhalers (n = 184), gum (n = 71), and patches (n = 55). Only the nicotine inhaler group showed statistically significant reduction in CO level from baseline at both weeks 4 and 8 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.032, respectively). The nicotine inhaler and the patch group showed significant decrease in nicotine withdrawal symptoms from baseline at both weeks 4 and 8. Meanwhile, the nicotine inhaler and the gum group showed significant decrease in psychiatric symptom severity from baseline at both weeks 4 and 8. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the inhaler group had a greater decrease in psychiatric symptom severity compared with the patch group. Conclusions Nicotine inhalers may be an effective choice for smoking reduction in acute psychiatric inpatient settings given its significant effects on CO level, withdrawal symptoms, and psychiatric symptom severity, particularly during the first 4 weeks of treatment. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical interventions and methodological challenges was reviewed to inform modern practice and future research. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed using search terms related to ileus and colorectal surgery. All RCTs involving an intervention to prevent or reduce POI published between 1990 and 2016 were identified. Grey literature, non-full-text manuscripts, and reanalyses of previous RCTs were excluded. Eligible articles were assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias. Results: Of 5614 studies screened, 86 eligible articles describing 88 RCTs were identified. Current knowledge of pathophysiology acknowledges neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms, but much of the evidence arises from animal studies. The most common interventions tested were chewing gum (11 trials) and early enteral feeding (11), which are safe but of unclear benefit for actively reducing POI. Others, including thoracic epidural analgesia (8), systemic lidocaine (8) and peripheral μ antagonists (5), show benefit but require further investigation for safety and cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: POI is a common condition with no established definition, aetiology or treatment. According to current literature, minimally invasive surgery, protocol-driven recovery (including early feeding and opioid avoidance strategies) and measures to avoid major inflammatory events (such as anastomotic leak) offer the best chances of reducing POI.","Comments":"2021-05-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chapman S J; Pericleous A; Downey C; Jayne D G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/bjs.10781","Keywords":"acupuncture needle\r\nnasogastric tube\r\n17 methylnaltrexone\r\nalvimopan\r\nbisacodyl\r\nbupivacaine\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncaffeine\r\ncholine\r\ncisapride\r\ncitric acid\r\nclonidine\r\ndaikenchuto\r\ndextromethorphan\r\ndiatrizoate\r\nerythromycin\r\nescin\r\nfentanyl\r\nhydromorphone\r\ninterleukin 8\r\nketorolac\r\nlidocaine\r\nmagnesium oxide\r\nmeglumine diatrizoate\r\nmeglumine diatrizoate plus sodium diatrizoate\r\nmetoclopramide\r\nmorphine\r\nmosapride\r\nmu opiate receptor antagonist\r\nnonsteroid antiinflammatory agent\r\nprokinetic agent\r\nprostaglandin synthase inhibitor\r\nropivacaine\r\nsodium chloride\r\ntumor necrosis factor\r\nabdominal surgery\r\nacupuncture\r\nbleeding\r\ncatheter infection\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee\r\ncolon surgery\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ncontinuous infusion\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\ndefecation\r\ndrug use\r\nelectroacupuncture\r\nenteric feeding\r\nepidural analgesia\r\nfeces\r\nflatulence\r\nfluid intake\r\nfluid therapy\r\ngastrointestinal disease\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\ngastrointestinal transit\r\nhuman\r\nintestine motility\r\nintestine sound\r\nintestine surgery\r\nintubation\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nlaparoscopy\r\nlength of stay\r\nlow residue diet\r\nmassage\r\nmastication\r\nnonhuman\r\nopen surgery\r\nopioid induced constipation\r\npain assessment\r\nparenteral nutrition\r\npathogenesis\r\npathophysiology\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative period\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nrisk\r\nstomach emptying\r\nswallowing\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy effect\r\ngastrografin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chapman S J, Pericleous A, Downey C, and Jayne D G (2018) Postoperative ileus following major colorectal surgery.

The observed effects of chewing gum on the amount of saliva, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and degree of thirst in patients on HD have been inconsistent. We investigated whether chewing gum can modulate these three parameters in patients on HD. Materials and Methods: We used purposive sampling to enroll 37 patients on HD who were then randomly divided into the chewing gum group (n = 19) and the control (non-chewing gum) group (n = 18). The degree of thirst was assessed using a self-rated visual analog scale (VAS) and a summated xerostomia inventory (SXI), respectively. Results: The degree of thirst after dialysis was significantly lower in the chewing gum group than in the control group. The amount of saliva was higher in the chewing gum group than in the control group before dialysis, but the saliva amount was comparable between the groups after dialysis. Furthermore, the amount of saliva was not associated with IDWG in patients on HD before or after dialysis. Conclusions: Chewing gum may alleviate the feeling of thirst but may not affect the amount of saliva and IDWG in patients on HD. Therefore, we suggest that chewing gum may be a useful approach to improve dry mouth and thirst in patients on HD.","Comments":"2024-02-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chen Y Q; Wang C L; Chiu A H; Yeh M C; Chiang T I; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/medicina60010002","Keywords":"body weight gain\r\nchewing gum\r\nhemodialysis\r\nhuman\r\nsaliva\r\nthirst\r\nxerostomia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chen Y Q, Wang C L, Chiu A H, Yeh M C, and Chiang T I (2023) Chewing Gum May Alleviate Degree of Thirst in Patients on Hemodialysis.

Background: Postoperative chewing gum has been shown to be safe and effective for most surgeries, while the safety and efficacy of preoperative chewing gum are still controversial. Design: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was performed. No Patient or Public Contribution: This was a meta-analysis involving no people or animals. Methods: The literature search was performed in 9 databases from inception to July 2022. Randomised controlled trials that compared the safety and efficacy of preoperative chewing gum and preoperative chewing no gum in adult patients undergoing elective surgery were included. The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022330223. Results: Fourteen trials involving 1433 adult patients who undergo elective surgery were pooled in this meta-analysis. The results showed that preoperative chewing gum group resulted in no significant difference in gastric pH (p =.13) and gastric fluid volume (p =.25) compared with non-gum-chewing group. In comparison with the non-gum-chewing group, the gum-chewing group was associated with shorter preoperative thirst score (p =.02), lower incidence of postoperative nausea (p =.0004), lower incidence of postoperative sore throat, lower incidence of postoperative hoarseness, lower postoperative pain score, shorter first postoperative anal exhaust time (p <.00001), shorter first postoperative defecation time (p <.00001) and shorter hospital days (p =.02). Conclusions: Preoperative chewing gum was associated with lower discomforts and complication rates, without increasing gastric pH and gastric fluid volume. This strategy may be an innovative, feasible and safe choice for elective surgery in adults.

This meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of chewing gum in intestinal function recovery after colorectal cancer surgery. Methods.

Summary risk ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were used for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. Results. 17 RCTs with a total number of 1845 patients were included. Gum chewing following colorectal cancer surgery significantly reduced the time to first passage of flatus (WMD −0.55; 95% CI −0.94 to −0.16; P=0.006), first bowel movement (WMD −0.60; 95% CI −0.87 to −0.33; P&lt;0.0001), start feeding (WMD −1.32; 95% CI −2.18 to −0.46; P=0.003), and the length of postoperative hospital stay (WMD −0.88; 95% CI −1.59 to −0.17; P=0.01), but no obvious differences were found in postoperative nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, pneumonia, and mortality, which were consistent with the findings of intention to treat analysis. Conclusions. Chewing gum could accelerate the recovery of intestinal function after colorectal cancer surgery. However, it confers no advantage in postoperative clinical complications. Further large-scale and high-quality RCTs should be conducted to confirm these results.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mei Binbin; Wang Wenting; Cui Feifei; Wen Zunjia; Shen Meifen; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2017/3087904","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mei Binbin, Wang Wenting, Cui Feifei, Wen Zunjia, and Shen Meifen (    ) Chewing Gum for Intestinal Function Recovery after Colorectal Cancer Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis..

Trials were of moderate to low quality with different inclusion criteria. In most of the included trials chewing gum was given right after delivery, three times a day for 30 min each and until the first flatus. Women who were randomized to the chewing gum group had a significantly lower mean time to first flatus (MD - 6.49 h, 95%CI -8.65 to -4.33), to first bowel sounds (MD - 8.48 h, 95%CI -9.04 to -7.92), less duration of stay (MD - 0.39 days, 95%CI -0.78 to -0.18), lower time to first feces (MD - 9.57 h, 95% CI -10.28 to 8.87) and to the first feeling of hunger (MD - 2.89 h, 95%CI -4.93 to -0.85), less number of episodes of nausea or vomiting (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.87), less incidence of ileus (RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.19 to 0.80) and significantly higher satisfaction.<b>Conclusions: </b>Gum chewing starting right after cesarean delivery three times a day for about 30 min until the first flatus is associated with early recovery of bowel motility. As this is a simple, generally inexpensive intervention, providers should consider implementing cesarean postoperative care with gum chewing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ciardulli Andrea; Saccone Gabriele; Di Mascio Daniele; Caissutti Claudia; Berghella Vincenzo; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14767058.2017.1330883","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ciardulli Andrea, Saccone Gabriele, Di Mascio Daniele, Caissutti Claudia, and Berghella Vincenzo (    ) Chewing gum improves postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function after cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials..

Methods: Eighty-eight patients undergoing inpatient gynecologic surgery were consecutively enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized into two groups, a chewing gum and a control. Both the gum and control groups were ordered clear liquid diets to advance as tolerated and to report first flatus. Outcome measures included time to first flatus and hospital length of stay. Results: For the 80 patients eligible, there was no statistically significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, smoking history, type of surgery, or length of surgery. The gum group had an average first flatus at 40.36 hours postoperative compared to 51.43 hours for the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P =.08). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a shorter time to first flatus in patients who chewed gum postoperatively but this result was not statistically significant.

Design A 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 randomized factorial experiment. Setting Eleven primary care clinics in Wisconsin, USA. Participants A total of 544 smokers (59% women, 86% white) recruited during primary care visits and motivated to quit. Interventions Five intervention components designed to help smokers attain and maintain abstinence: (1) extended medication (26 versus 8 weeks of nicotine patch + nicotine gum); (2) maintenance (phone) counseling versus none; (3) medication adherence counseling versus none; (4) automated (medication) adherence calls versus none; and (5) electronic medication monitoring with feedback and counseling versus electronic medication monitoring alone. Measurements The primary outcome was 7-day self-reported point-prevalence abstinence 1 year after the target quit day. Findings Only extended medication produced a main effect. Twenty-six versus 8 weeks of medication improved point-prevalence abstinence rates (43 versus 34% at 6 months; 34 versus 27% at 1 year; P = 0.01 for both). There were four interaction effects at 1 year, showing that an intervention component's effectiveness depended upon the components with which it was combined. Conclusions Twenty-six weeks of nicotine patch + nicotine gum (versus 8 weeks) and maintenance counseling provided by phone are promising intervention components for the cessation and maintenance phases of smoking treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schlam Tanya R; Fiore Michael C; Smith Stevens S; Fraser David; Bolt Daniel M; Collins Linda M; Mermelstein Robin; Piper Megan E; Cook Jessica W; Jorenby Douglas E; Loh Wei‐Yin; Baker Timothy B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13153","Keywords":"Smoking Cessation\r\nSmoking Cessation Programs\r\nMotivation\r\nHuman\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nRandom Assignment\r\nPrimary Health Care\r\nWisconsin\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nCounseling\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nNicotine Replacement Therapy\r\nNicotine Patch\r\nChewing Gum\r\nTreatment Outcomes\r\nRecurrence Prevention and Control\r\nInterviews\r\nScales\r\nLogistic Regression\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nCarbon Monoxide Analysis\r\nRecurrence\r\nFunding Source\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nMale\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schlam Tanya R, Fiore Michael C, Smith Stevens S, Fraser David, Bolt Daniel M, Collins Linda M, Mermelstein Robin, Piper Megan E, Cook Jessica W, Jorenby Douglas E, Loh Wei‐Yin, and Baker Timothy B (    ) Comparative effectiveness of intervention components for producing long-term abstinence from smoking: a factorial screening experiment..

The use of non-pharmacological therapies can make the childbirth process a pleasurable event for the mother. This study aimed to compare the effects of watching virtual reality videos and chewing gum on the length of delivery stages and maternal satisfaction. Methods: This clinical trial study was performed on 93 women with first and second pregnancies, who were referred to Allameh Bohlool Hospital in Gonabad and Sajjadieh Hospital in Torbat-e-Jam, Iran, for childbirth between 2018 and 2019. Pregnant women were randomly assigned to three groups of chewing gum, virtual reality, and control. Interventions were performed twice: in the active (dilation of 4-5 cm) and second (dilation of 7-8 cm) phases of parturition for 20 minutes each. Data were collected using data-gathering forms, including a demographic characteristics form, a midwifery characteristics form, and the Mackey Childbirth Satisfaction Rating Scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22, via the Chi square tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Tukey's post hoc tests. Results: The difference in the mean maternal childbirth satisfaction score between the two intervention groups of virtual reality and chewing gum was not statistically significant (P=0.339), but the mean score in the intervention groups was higher than that of the control group (P&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean length of the active and second phases of parturition between the two intervention groups, but this value in the intervention groups was significantly lower than that of the control group. Conclusion: The thought divergence interventions of chewing gum and watching virtual reality videos enhanced childbirth satisfaction, and curtailed parturition stages in our sample of pregnant women.

Our aim was to compare a new treatment, chewing gum, with a widely-used intravenous agent, ondansetron, to treat PONV in female patients in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial in 17 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Female patients aged ≥12 years undergoing volatile anesthetic-based general anesthesia for laparoscopic or breast surgery were enrolled. Protocolized anti-emetic prophylaxis was administered. Patients who developed PONV in the PACU were randomized to either 15 min of chewing gum or 4 mg of intravenous ondansetron. The primary outcome was cessation of nausea, retching or vomiting, with no recurrence nor rescue medication for 2 h after administration of the randomized intervention (i.e., complete response). RESULTS: Of 865 enrolled patients, 218 were randomized. In a per-protocol analysis, 50 of 105 (47.6%) ondansetron-treated patients compared with 31 of 103 (30.1%) chewing gum-treated patients achieved the primary outcome (absolute risk difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] -17.3 [-30.4 to -4.3] %), not reaching our prespecified non-inferiority limit. Time to complete response was longer for patients randomized to chewing gum (hazard ratio [95% CI] 0.53 [0.34, 0.83]), and they were more likely to receive antiemetics in the 24 h after surgery (absolute risk difference [95% CI] 14.07 [1.65, 26.49]). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum cannot be recommended as an alternative to ondansetron for treatment of PONV in female patients administered antiemetic prophylaxis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Darvall J N; De Silva A P; von Ungern-Sternberg B; Story D A; Davidson A J; Allen M L; Tran-Duy A; Schultz-Ferguson C; Ha V; Braat S; Leslie K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ALN.0000000000005283","Keywords":"antiemetic agent\r\nondansetron\r\nadult\r\nadverse drug reaction\r\narticle\r\nattributable risk\r\nbreast surgery\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug therapy\r\nfemale\r\ngeneral anesthesia\r\nhealth care cost\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmulticenter study\r\nnausea\r\nnon-inferiority trial\r\nper protocol analysis\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrecovery room\r\nrecurrent disease\r\nretching\r\nside effect\r\nsurgery\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Darvall J N, De Silva A P, von Ungern-Sternberg B, Story D A, Davidson A J, Allen M L, Tran-Duy A, Schultz-Ferguson C, Ha V, Braat S, and Leslie K (2024) Chewing gum to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients: a multicenter randomized trial.

Previous studies suggested that chewing gum stimulates bowel function after abdominal surgery, but were underpowered to evaluate its effect on LOS and did not include enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)-based perioperative care. This study evaluated whether chewing gum after elective abdominal surgery reduces LOS and time to bowel recovery in the setting of ERAS-based perioperative care. Methods: A multicentre RCT was performed of patients over 18 years of age undergoing abdominal surgery in 12 hospitals. Standard postoperative care (control group) was compared with chewing gum three times a day for 30 min in addition to standard postoperative care. Randomization was computer-generated; allocation was concealed. The primary outcome was postoperative LOS. Secondary outcomes were time to bowel recovery and 30-day complications. Results: Between 2011 to 2015, 1000 patients were assigned to chewing gum and 1000 to the control arm. Median LOS did not differ: 7 days in both arms (P = 0·364). Neither was any difference found in time to flatus (24 h in control group versus 23 h with chewing gum; P = 0·873) or time to defaecation (60 versus 52 h respectively; P = 0·562). The rate of 30-day complications was not significantly different either. Conclusion: The addition of chewing gum to an ERAS postoperative care pathway after elective abdominal surgery does not reduce the LOS, time to bowel recovery or the rate of postoperative complications.

This is called gastric belching. Supragastric belching occurs when swallowed air does not reach the stomach and returns by mouth a short time after swallowing. This situation may cause discomfort, life limitations and problems in daily life. Objective - Our objective in this investigation was to evaluate if gum chewing increases the frequency of gastric and/or supragastric belches. Methods - Esophageal transit of liquid and gas was evaluated by impedance measurement in 16 patients with complaint of troublesome belching and in 15 controls. The Rome III criteria were used in the diagnosis of troublesome belching. The esophageal transit of liquid and gas was measured at 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm from the lower esophageal sphincter. The subjects were eval­uated for 1 hour which was divided into three 20-minute periods: (1) while sitting for a 20-minute base period; (2) after the ingestion of yogurt (200 mL, 190 kcal), in which the subjects were evaluated while chewing or not chewing gum; (3) final 20-minute period in which the subjects then inverted the task of chewing or not chewing gum. In gastric belch, the air flowed from the stomach through the esophagus in oral direction and in supragastric belch the air entered the esophagus rapidly from proximal and was expulsed almost immediately in oral direction. Air swallows were characterized by an increase of at least 50% of basal impedance and saliva swallow by a decrease of at least 50% of basal impedance, that progress from proximal to distal esophagus. Results - In base period, air swallowing was more frequent in patients than in controls and saliva swallowing was more frequent in controls than in patients. There was no difference between the medians of controls and patients in the number of gastric belches and supragastric belches. In six patients, supragastric belches were seen at least once during the 20-minute base period. None of the controls had supragastric belches. In the control group, the ingestion of yogurt caused no significant alteration in the number of air swallows, saliva swallows, gastric belches and supragastric belches. In the patient group, there was an increase in the number of air swallows. If the subjects were chewing gum during this 20-minute period, there was an increase in the number of saliva swallows in both groups, without alterations of the number of air swallow, gastric belches and supragastric belches. There was no alteration in the number of the saliva swallows, air swallows, gastric belches and supragastric belches in both groups for subjects who did not chew gum in the 20-40 minute period after yogurt ingestion. When the subjects were chewing the gum, there was an increase in saliva swallows in the control and patients groups and in air swallows in the patients group. Conclusion - Gum chewing causes an increase in saliva swallowing in both patients with excessive belching and in controls, and an increase in air swallowing in patients with excessive belching 20 minutes after yogurt ingestion. Gum chewing did not increase or decrease the frequency of gastric or supragastric belches.","Comments":"2015-10-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Silva A C.V; Aprile L R.O; Dantas R O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1590/S0004-28032015000300007","Keywords":"adult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndepression\r\ndysphagia\r\neructation\r\nfemale\r\nheartburn\r\nhuman\r\nlower esophagus sphincter\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\nstomach pain","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Silva A C.V, Aprile L R.O, and Dantas R O (2015) Effect of gum chewing on air swallowing, saliva swallowing and belching.

Finding uncomplicated, non-prescriptive solutions to reduce the dry mouth and irritation of these patients seems quite crucial. Since chewing sugar free gum is likely to alleviate these complications through increasing the flow of saliva, the present study was conducted to investigate the impact of sugar free gum on the thirst and dry mouth of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Materials and method: The present quasi-experimental study was performed on 50 patients undergoing hemodialysis who met inclusion criteria. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of sugar free gum chewing and control; the thirst and dry mouth of the patients were evaluated by means of a dialysis thirst quotient instrument (DTI, dry mouth measurement tools (XI), VAS). Patients of intervention group were told to chew sugar free gum for one week when they felt thirsty; however, the control group did not receive any intervention. The thirst and dry mouth of the patients were again measured and analyzed using SPSS version 22 after the intervention. Findings: According to the results of the present study, there turned out to be a significant difference between thirst and dry mouth and chewing sugar free gum before and after the intervention (P < 0.05). However, the thirst and dry mouth of the patients before and after the intervention did not show any significant difference in the control group (P > 0.05). Also, there was no significant difference in the comparison of thirst and dry mouth between the two groups before the intervention (P > 0.05); while this difference turned out to be significant after the intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, which showed the effect of sugar-free gum in reducing the thirst and dry mouth of hemodialysis patients, and given the low cost and availability of this intervention and that no specific complication was identified for them, therefore, it is possible to use this method in various patients who suffer from dry mouth and thirst for various reasons, including patients undergoing hemodialysis.","Comments":"2018-05-18","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dehghanmehr S; Sheikh A; Siyasari A; Karimkoshteh M H; Sheikh G; Salarzaei M; Nooraien S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.9(5).2062-66","Keywords":"adult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease severity\r\nfemale\r\nhemodialysis\r\nhuman\r\nIran\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\npolydipsia\r\nquasi experimental study\r\nsex ratio\r\nxerostomia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dehghanmehr S, Sheikh A, Siyasari A, Karimkoshteh M H, Sheikh G, Salarzaei M, and Nooraien S (2018) Investigating the impact of sugar free gum on the thirst and dry mouth of patients undergoing hemodialysis.

J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1671-1676, 2021-This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeinated chewing gum on endurance exercise, neuromuscular properties, and rate of perceived exertion on exercise tolerance. Twelve trained male runners (31.3 ± 6.4 years; 70.5 ± 6.6 kg; 175.2 ± 6.2 cm; 9.4 ± 2.7% body fat; and V̇o2max = 62.0 ± 4.2 ml·kg-1·min-1) took part of the study. The athletes performed an intermittent treadmill test to determine maximal aerobic speed and delta 50% (Δ50%) intensity. In the following visits, they performed 2 randomized time to exhaustion tests (15.4 ± 0.7 km·h-1) after the ingestion of 300 mg of caffeine in a double-blind, crossover, randomized design. Maximal voluntary contraction of the knee extensor associated to surface electromyographic recording and the twitch interpolation technique were assessed before and immediately after the tests to quantify neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor muscles. Caffeine significantly improved exercise tolerance by 18% (p < 0.01). Neuromuscular responses decreased similarly after time to exhaustion in both exercise conditions; however, athletes were able to run a longer distance in the caffeine condition. The performance improvement induced by caffeine seems to have a neuromuscular contribution because athletes were able to run a longer distance with the same neuromuscular impairment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dittrich N; Serpa MC; Lemos EC; De Lucas RD; Guglielmo LGA; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1519/JSC.0000000000002966 ","Keywords":"*Caffeine/pharmacology\r\n*Chewing Gum\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nExercise\r\nExercise Test\r\nExercise Tolerance\r\nHumans\r\nMale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dittrich N, Serpa MC, Lemos EC, De Lucas RD, and Guglielmo LGA (2021) Effects of Caffeine Chewing Gum on Exercise Tolerance and Neuromuscular Responses in Well-Trained Runners..

Data Sources: We screened 5 major databases (Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov) from inception till February 2023. Methods of Study Selection: No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials comparing the postoperative bowel function between patients who chewed and patients who did not chew gum postoperatively after laparoscopic gynecological procedures for benign indications. Tabulation, Integration, and Results: Data from 5 studies on 670 patients were extracted and analyzed by 3 independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4 software (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020), with mean differences (MDs), pooled risk ratios, and random-effects model. Postoperative gum chewing significantly reduced the time to first bowel sounds and the time to first passage of flatus (MD −2.58 hours 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.12 to −1.04 p = .001 and MD −3.97 hours 95% CI −6.26 to −1.68 p <.001, respectively). The time to first defecation, the time to first postoperative patients’ mobilization, the length of hospital stay, and the risk of postoperative bowel obstruction showed no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. When subgroup analysis was performed according to the type of the laparoscopic procedure, it failed to reveal a positive impact of postoperative gum chewing in both the times to first passage of flatus and first defecation following laparoscopic hysterectomies (MD −5.35 hours 95% CI −10.93 to 0.23 p = .06 and MD −15.93 hours 95% CI −40.13 to 8.28 p = .20, respectively). Conclusion: The results of the present meta-analysis support that postoperative gum chewing following laparoscopic gynecological procedures seems to have a positive effect on the early mobilization of the gastrointestinal tract. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of the included randomized controlled clinical trials. © 2023 AAGL","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Douligeris A; Diakosavvas M; Kathopoulis N; Kypriotis K; Mortaki A; Angelou K; Chatzipapas I; Protopapas A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Douligeris A, Diakosavvas M, Kathopoulis N, Kypriotis K, Mortaki A, Angelou K, Chatzipapas I, and Protopapas A (2023) The Effect of Postoperative Gum Chewing on Gastrointestinal Function Following Laparoscopic Gynecological Surgery.

Chewing is a kind of sham feeding that has been reported to stimulate bowel motility, but so far there was no study showed these positive results may or may not be extrapolated to the spinal surgery population. We sought to determine whether chewing gum facilitates bowel function recovery in elderly patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. METHODS: Sixty consecutive elderly patients (over 60 years old) with lumbar degenerative diseases undergoing posterior lumbar fusion surgery between September 2017 and April 2019 were respectively included and divided into two groups. The chewing gum group (30 patients) started chewing gum after they were awakened from anesthesia until the first defecation occurred, while the control group (30 patients) chewed nothing. The time to first flatus, first bowel sounds heard and first defecation, the length of hospital stay and postoperative complications were all recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the chewing gum group had less time to the first flatus (12.4±2.9 vs. 17.8±2.2 h; P<0.001), first bowel sounds heard (17.3±2.8 vs. 25.0±2.5 h; P<0.001) and first defecation (51.9±5.2 vs. 76.1±3.8 h; P<0.001), but no significant differences were found in the length of hospital stay (11.7±2.1 vs. 11.9±2.5 d; P=0.697) and the postoperative complications (P=0.501).

There is a lack of uniformity in enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs) with regards to interventions used to target these complications. This systematic review aims to categorize and summarize management recommendations available from published ERPs. METHODS: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and PubMed databases was performed from January 1990 to May 2018. All studies publishing enhanced recovery or fast-track or multimodal pathway protocols for colorectal surgery in their full-text were included. Data on interventions aimed at reducing the duration of POI were extracted, as well as references quoted to support specific interventions. RESULTS: Of 481 manuscripts screened, 37 published ERPs were identified from 37 studies (18 cohort, seven historical-control, five guidelines, four randomized controlled trials, one randomized controlled trial protocol, one case series and one narrative review). The most commonly recommended interventions were magnesium-based laxatives (18 of 37, 48.6%), chewing gum (13 of 37, 35.1%), Alvimopan (6 of 37, 16.2%), lactulose (4 of 37, 10.8%), neostigmine (2 of 37, 5.4%) and bisacodyl (2 of 37, 5.4%). Geographical trends were noted for the various interventions, but high-quality evidence was only referenced to support the use of Alvimopan.

In this randomized controlled study, the sample consisted of adult patients who had undergone elective open left colon and/or rectal surgical interventions under general anesthesia. The sample comprised 17 patients in the experimental group and control group. The patients in the experimental group chewed a sugar-free gum after removal of their nasogastric tubes, 3 times a day for 45 minutes, from the first postoperative morning until they had first flatus. Routine care was maintained for the patients in the control group until their first flatus. The effects of chewing gum on the length of time until first flatus, the first defecation in the postoperative period, and the discharge of patients were investigated. The patients in the experimental group had flatus and defecation earlier, and the duration of their hospital stay was shorter than those of patients in the control group. It was found that gum chewing as a physiological method promotes the early initiation of bowel functions and, consequently, shortens the hospital stay after elective left colon and/or rectal surgery. © 2020 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Duluklu B; Celik S S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duluklu B, and Celik S S (2020) Effect of Gum Chewing on Recovery after Surgery for Colorectal Surgery Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Objectives: To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015. Selection criteria: Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow-up of at least six months. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Main results: We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control. Statistical heterogeneity was evident among the 17 trials of behavioural interventions: eight of them reported statistically and clinically significant benefits; six suggested benefit but with wide CIs and no statistical significance; and three had similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity was not explained by study design (individual or cluster randomization), whether participants were selected for interest in quitting, or specific intervention components. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, trials of behavioural interventions incorporating telephone support, with or without oral examination and feedback, were associated with larger effect sizes, but oral examination and feedback alone were not associated with benefit. In one trial an interactive website increased abstinence more than a static website. One trial comparing immediate cessation using nicotine patch versus a reduction approach using either nicotine lozenge or brand switching showed greater success for the abrupt cessation group. Authors' conclusions: Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ebbert J O; Elrashidi M Y; Stead L F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ebbert J O, Elrashidi M Y, and Stead L F (2015) Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation.

Methods: This study was conducted in a maternity clinic as a randomized controlled experimental study. Ninety-six women were randomly divided into three groups. The sample of the study consisted of 96 pregnant women, 32 in the GG group, 32 in the BG use group, and 32 in the control group (CG). When the mother’s pain began in the latent phase and active phase; The group using the BG had the BG squeezed for 20 min, the GG group had gum chewed for 20 min, and the CG received only standard care. Women were evaluated before and after the intervention in terms of pain intensity and postintervention satisfaction level. Personal information form, labor follow-up form, Visual Analog Scale, and birth satisfaction scale were used to collect data. Results: After the interventions, labor pain was less in the GG and BG groups than in the CG. At the same time, birth satisfaction in the GG and BG groups was higher than the CG (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: GG and using BG techniques are extremely effective in alleviating labor pain and satisfaction in primiparous women. There was no difference in labor pain reduction between the two interventions. These interventions have no effect on labor duration. These results show that GG and BG are effective nursing interventions for relieving labor pain and can be safely used.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"ÇETİNKAYA Şahika ŞİMŞEK; DURMUŞ Ayşenur; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4274/forbes.galenos.2024.71501","Keywords":"Chewing Gum Therapeutic Use\r\nStress, Psychological Equipment and Supplies\r\nLabor Pain Prevention and Control\r\nChildbirth Psychosocial Factors\r\nPatient Satisfaction Evaluation\r\nTreatment Outcomes\r\nHuman\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nRandom Assignment\r\nPregnancy\r\nFemale\r\nComparative Studies\r\nVisual Analog Scaling\r\nScales\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"ÇETİNKAYA Şahika ŞİMŞEK, and DURMUŞ Ayşenur (    ) Effect of Chewing Gum and Stress Ball on Labor Pain, Duration of Labor, and Birth Satisfaction: A Randomized Controlled Study..

Post cesarean ileus is a complication of CS. There are various pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical ways for the treatment of this condition. Given the fact that the non-pharmaceutical approaches are better tolerated and often inexpensive, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of chewing gum on post cesarean ileus. Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 93 patients undergoing CS (i.e., elective or urgent CS) at Sabzevar Mobini Hospital, Savzevar, Iran, between July 2013 and September 2014. The study population was selected using convenience sampling technique and assigned into two groups of chewing gum (n=35) and control (n=58) groups. The subjects in the chewing gum group were encouraged to chew gum at defined intervals. Both groups were evaluated for pain, bowel sounds, first defecations, gas passage, and feeling bowel movements. Data analysis was performed in SPSS software, version 21. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the auscultation of first bowel sound, first record of gas passing, and first defecation. The logistic regression models showed that chewing gum was significantly associated with reduced post-operative pain while controlling for surgery duration as a confounding factor (OR: 0.79, 95% CI for OR=0.63, 0.99). However, chewing gum showed no significant relationship with bowel sounds, first defecations, gas passage, and feeling bowel movements. Conclusion: As the findings indicated, the use of chewing gum after CS was ineffective in the reduction of ileus. However, this practice was only capable of mitigating post-operative pain, and therefore can be used as an adjuvant technique for the management of post-operative pain.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Esfehani Reza Jafarzadeh; Yazd Marzyeh Moosavi; Esfehani Jafarzadeh; Foji Samira; Kamalimanesh Batool; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.22038/jmrh.2018.20694.1219","Keywords":"Chewing Gum\r\nIntestinal Obstruction Prevention and Control\r\nCesarean Section\r\nHuman\r\nIran\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nConvenience Sample\r\nQuestionnaires\r\nInterviews\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nT-Tests\r\nMann-Whitney U Test\r\nRepeated Measures\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nLogistic Regression\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nFunding Source","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Esfehani Reza Jafarzadeh, Yazd Marzyeh Moosavi, Esfehani Jafarzadeh, Foji Samira, and Kamalimanesh Batool (    ) Effect of Chewing Gum on Post Cesarean Ileus in the North East of Iran: A Randomized Clinical Trial..

The results of this study suggest that natural hydro-distilled neroli-flavored chewing gum can reduce anxiety in university students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Esmaeelian Mozhgan; Esmaeelian Elahe; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.explore.2024.103028","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Esmaeelian Mozhgan, and Esmaeelian Elahe (    ) Effect of neroli-flavored chewing gum on anxiety..

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeinated chewing gum on exercise performance and physiological responses in a systematic review. Methods: All articles were searched using the PubMed and Scopus databases to include articles published up to June 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Evaluation and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Results: Thirty-two studies were finally included. Most studies have found that pre-exercise caffeinated chewing gum supplementation is effective in improving endurance, repetitive sprinting, lower limb strength, and sport-specific performance, as well as lowering rating of perceived exertion (RPE) or fatigue index even with lower dosages of caffeine. Sympathetic activation may be one of the mechanisms by which caffeinated chewing gum affects athletic performance. No significant effect on energy metabolism indicators (blood glucose, blood lactate, free fatty acids) was found. In addition, two studies found that caffeinated chewing gum reduced or maintained cortisol levels and increased testosterone levels. However, caffeinated chewing gum intake does not have an impact on catecholamines and β-endorphins. There have been inconsistent results for explosive performance, agility performance, and pain perception. Only a few studies have examined balance performance. In conclusion, a low dose of caffeine (100–300 mg or 2–4 mg/kg) in the form of chewing gum is rapidly absorbed and utilized, positively impacting most exercise and physiological performance. Conclusions: Future studies should also consider the performance variables of agility, pain perception, and explosive performance to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of caffeinated chewing gum on sympathetic activation and exercise performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yang Chia-Cheng; Hsieh Meng-Hung; Ho Chien-Chang; Chang Ya-Hui; Shiu Yi-Jie; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu16213611","Keywords":"Caffeine Therapeutic Use\r\nFluid Intake\r\nChewing Gum Therapeutic Use\r\nCaffeine Pharmacodynamics\r\nExercise Physiology\r\nAthletic Performance\r\nTreatment Outcomes\r\nHuman\r\nSystematic Review\r\nPubMed\r\nChewing Gum Utilization\r\nPhysical Endurance\r\nSprinting\r\nMuscle Strength\r\nLower Extremity\r\nHydrocortisone Blood\r\nTestosterone Blood\r\nCatecholamines Blood\r\nAgility\r\nCaffeine Administration and Dosage\r\nErgogenic Products","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yang Chia-Cheng, Hsieh Meng-Hung, Ho Chien-Chang, Chang Ya-Hui, and Shiu Yi-Jie (    ) Effects of Caffeinated Chewing Gum on Exercise Performance and Physiological Responses: A Systematic Review..

Its pathophysiology is diverse and variable, involving disturbed gut–brain interactions, altered motility and secretion, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability, immune activation, and changes in gut microbiota. Complaints experienced by patients suffering from IBS and its co-morbidities strongly impair quality of life (QoL), and available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports and preclinical data suggest that the endocannabinoid system and functionally related mechanisms could offer treatment targets. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a candidate agent of interest with a broad molecular target profile and the absence of psychoactive properties. Materials and Methods: In 32 female IBS patients, we explored the effect of a chewing gum formulation containing 50 mg CBD on abdominal pain and perceived well-being in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Chewing gums were used on-demand guided by pain symptoms with a maximum of six per day. Pain intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale (scale 0.0–10.0), and QoL was evaluated with the IBS-36 questionnaire. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level. Subgroup and individual analyses showed a highly variable picture. No indications were found for symptom-driven intake, which also remained lower than expected overall. Conclusions: With the current design, based on the assumption that IBS patients would adjust their intake to their perceived symptom relief, no differences at the group level were found between CBD and placebo gum in pain scores and the number of gums used. The low use of the gums also indicates that the benefits experienced by these patients generally did not outweigh practical disadvantages such as prolonged chewing throughout the day. The very high intra- and inter-individual variation in IBS symptoms warrant future trials that are more personalized, for example by applying an N-of-1 (rotating) design with individualized dose titration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van Orten-Luiten Anne-Claire B; de Roos Nicole M; Majait Soumia; Witteman Ben J.M; Witkamp Renger F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/can.2020.0087","Keywords":"Cannabidiol Administration and Dosage\r\nChewing Gum\r\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome Drug Therapy\r\nAbdominal Pain\r\nSelf Concept\r\nQuality of Life\r\nDrug Efficacy\r\nHuman\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nRandom Assignment\r\nDouble-Blind Studies\r\nCrossover Design\r\nFemale\r\nPain Measurement\r\nVisual Analog Scaling\r\nQuestionnaires\r\nScales\r\nNetherlands\r\nAdolescence\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nAged\r\nPaired T-Tests\r\nWilcoxon Signed Rank Test\r\nMann-Whitney U Test\r\nUnpaired T-Tests\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nInpatients\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nAdolescent: 13-18 years\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nAged: 65+ years\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"van Orten-Luiten Anne-Claire B, de Roos Nicole M, Majait Soumia, Witteman Ben J.M, and Witkamp Renger F (    ) Effects of Cannabidiol Chewing Gum on Perceived Pain and Well-Being of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Placebo-Controlled Crossover Exploratory Intervention Study with Symptom-Driven Dosing..

The delay of bowel functions after cesarean influences early parenthood experience, increases the need for analgesic use, extends the duration of hospital stay, and causes cost increase. This study aimed to explore the effect of xylitol gum chewing after cesarean on bowel functions. Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted on subjects immediately after second hour of the cesarean in a ward of maternity. Methods: A total of 69 women were randomized to the xylitol gum chewing group (n = 23), the nonxylitol gum chewing group (n = 23), or the control group (n = 23). Data were collected from the women who agreed to participate and met the inclusion criteria. Starting with the second hour after the cesarean, women in the xylitol and nonxylitol gum chewing group were asked to chew gum for 15 minutes every 2 hours. The practice of chewing gum minimum of 8 hours and a maximum of 12 hours continued (until midnight). The data regarding the first times for bowel sounds, flatulation, defecation, a feeling of hunger, and length of hospital stay were compared. Findings: There is no difference in starting time of first bowel sounds (P =.070) and the first feeling of hunger (P =.098) among the groups. The first flatulation started at an earlier time in the xylitol gum chewing group than the control group (17.35 ± 6.27 vs 11.18 ± 5.39 hours, P =.003); first defecation time started earlier in the xylitol gum chewing group than nonxylitol gum chewing group (44.05 ± 9.4 vs 37.58 ± 9.96 hours, P =.022). Xylitol gum chewing group (51.77 ± 10.3 vs 46.33 ± 8.11 hours, P =.028) and nonxylitol gum chewing group (51.77 ± 10.3 vs 50.23 ± 5.72 hours, P =.024) were discharged from the hospital earlier than control group. Conclusions: In nursing care after cesarean, early period xylitol gum chewing is an efficient and user-friendly method to prompt bowel functions earlier.

This umbrella review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of current evidence on measures to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses–compliant systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus to identify systematic reviews that assessed the efficacy of interventions used to prevent postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery. Data on study characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were summarized in a narrative manner. Results: A total of 26 systematic reviews incorporating various strategies like early oral feeding, gum chewing, coffee consumption, medications, and acupuncture were included. Early oral feeding reduced postoperative ileus and accelerated bowel function return. The most assessed intervention was chewing gum, which was associated with a median reduction of postoperative ileus by 45% (range, 11%–59%) and shortening of the time to first flatus and time to defecation by a median of 11.9 and 17.7 hours, respectively. Coffee intake showed inconsistent results, with a median shortening of time to flatus and time to defecation by 1.32 and 14.45 hours, respectively. Conclusion: Early oral feeding, chewing gum, and alvimopan were the most commonly assessed and effective strategies for reducing postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery. Medications used to reduce postoperative ileus included alvimopan, intravenous lidocaine, dexamethasone, probiotics, and oral antibiotics. Intravenous dexamethasone and lidocaine and oral probiotics helped hasten bowel function return. Acupuncture positively impacted the recovery of bowel function.","Comments":"2024-01-26","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Emile S H; Horesh N; Garoufalia Z; Gefen R; Ray-Offor E; Wexner S D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.surg.2023.10.005","Keywords":"alvimopan\r\nantibiotic agent\r\ndexamethasone\r\nlidocaine\r\nnonsteroid antiinflammatory agent\r\nprobiotic agent\r\nserotonin uptake inhibitor\r\nacupuncture\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncoffee consumption\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ndefecation\r\ndisease severity\r\nenhanced recovery after surgery\r\nfeeding\r\nflatulence\r\nfluid intake\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine preparation\r\noutcome assessment\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\r\nqualitative analysis\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Emile S H, Horesh N, Garoufalia Z, Gefen R, Ray-Offor E, and Wexner S D (2024) Strategies to reduce ileus after colorectal surgery: A qualitative umbrella review of the collective evidence.

However, little is known about which reduction treatment elements increase quit attempts and the uptake of cessation treatment amongst such smokers. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a 4-factor randomized factorial experiment conducted amongst primary care patients (N = 517) presenting for regular healthcare visits in Southern Wisconsin who were unwilling to quit smoking but willing to cut down. We evaluated the main and interactive effects of Motivation-phase intervention components on whether participants: 1) made a quit attempt (intentional abstinence ≥24 h) by 6- and 26-weeks post-study enrollment and, 2) used cessation treatment. We also evaluated the relations of quit attempts with abstinence. The four intervention components evaluated were: 1) Nicotine Patch vs. None; 2) Nicotine Gum vs. None; 3) Motivational Interviewing (MI) vs. None; and 4) Behavioral Reduction Counseling (BR) vs. None. Intervention components were administered over 6 weeks, with an option to repeat treatment; participants could request cessation treatment at any point. Results: Nicotine gum significantly increased the likelihood of making a quit attempt by 6 weeks (23% vs. 15% without gum; p <.05). Conversely, nicotine patch reduced quit attempts when used with BR.

However, no trial has investigated the effect of gum chewing on bowel preparation for colonoscopy in addition to polyethylene glycol (PEG). The objective of this study was to investigate whether gum chewing before colonoscopy can increase the quality of bowel preparation. Methods This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to the gum group or the control group. Patients in the gum group chewed sugar-free gum every 2 hours for 20 minutes each time from the end of drinking 2 L of PEG to the beginning of colonoscopy. Patients in the control group only received 2 L of PEG before colonoscopy. The quality of bowel preparation, procedure time, adenoma detection rate, patients’ tolerance, and adverse events were compared. Results Three hundred patients were included in the study (150 in the control group, 150 in the gum group). More than 90% of patients in both groups were satisfied with the process of bowel preparation, and the incidence of adverse events was comparable in the 2 groups (41.3% vs 46.0%, P = .42). The mean Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score was 6.2 ± 1.4 and 6.1 ± 1.2 in the control group and the gum group, respectively, and the difference between the 2 groups was not significant (P = .51). Conclusions This study indicates that gum chewing does not improve the quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy, but it can improve patients’ satisfaction with the process of bowel preparation and does not have negative effects on cleanliness.

Studies indicate that alternative sources of caffeine, such as caffeinated chewing gum, mouth rinses, energy gels, and coffee can improve performance. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of consuming caffeinated gum (CG) and repeated coffee mouth rinsing (CMR) on professional male table tennis players' aerobic capacity and explosive power. METHOD: A randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded study was conducted with eighteen male table tennis players (Age: 21.86 ± 2.40 yr, Height: 173.80 ± 6.88 cm, Weight: 61.81 ± 10.32 kg). In each test session, the participants were randomly placed in one of the three conditions including i) Chewing caffeinated gum (CG, n = 6), ii) Coffee mouth rinsing (CMR, n = 6), iii) Starch capsule as a placebo (PLA, n = 6). All participants consumed caffeine with an average dose of ∼3 to 4.5 mg·kg(-1). Also, a one-week interval was considered a washout period for each condition. First, the participants were given the required supplement and performed functional tests such as throwing medicine balls and Sargent's jump tests. Then, the maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), time to exhaustion (TTE), oxygen consumption equivalent at primary ventilatory threshold (VO(2) at VT(1)), and oxygen consumption equivalent at respiratory compensation point (VO(2) at RCP) were measured during the Bruce test. All data were analyzed using SPSS Windows software, repeated measure analysis ANOVA, and Bonferroni post hoc tests at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The current study's findings illustrated that TTE significantly increased in CG (p = 0.000) and CMR (p = 0.012) conditions compared to PLA, but no significant difference was observed between CMR and CG (p = 1.00). VO(2) at VT(1) was significantly higher in CG (p = 0.004) and CMR (p = 0.000) compared to PLA; however, no significant difference was observed between CMR and CG (p = 0.335). VO(2) at RCP increased significantly in CG (p = 0.000) and CMR (p = 0.000) compared to the PLA condition, and despite this, no significant difference was observed between CG and CMR (p = 1.000). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between the three conditions in VO(2max), throwing a medicine ball, and Sarjent's jump height. CONCLUSION: The study found that CMR and CG had a relatively positive impact on male table tennis players' aerobic capacity; however, they did not significantly improve their explosive power.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farmani A; Hemmatinafar M; Koushkie Jahromi M; Pirmohammadi S; Imanian B; Jahan Z; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15502783.2024.2340556 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nMale\r\n*Cross-Over Studies\r\nYoung Adult\r\n*Caffeine/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\n*Coffee\r\n*Athletic Performance/physiology\r\nMouthwashes/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nChewing Gum\r\nOxygen Consumption/drug effects\r\nSports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena\r\nTennis/physiology\r\nAdult\r\nCaffeine\r\naerobic capacity\r\ncaffeinated gum\r\ncoffee mouth rinsing\r\ntable tennis\r\ntime to exhaustion","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farmani A, Hemmatinafar M, Koushkie Jahromi M, Pirmohammadi S, Imanian B, and Jahan Z (2024) The effect of repeated coffee mouth rinsing and caffeinated gum consumption on aerobic capacity and explosive power of table tennis players: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study..

Semiprofessional male soccer players (n = 12, age: 22 ± 3 years, stature: 1.78 ± 0.06 m, mass: 75 ± 9 kg) performed 120-min soccer-specific exercise on two occasions. In a triple-blind, randomized, crossover design, players chewed caffeinated (200 mg; caffeine) or control (0 mg; placebo) gum for 5 min following 90 min of soccer-specific exercise. Perceptual-cognitive skills (i.e., passing accuracy, reaction time, composure, and adaptability) were assessed using a soccer-specific virtual reality simulator, collected pre- and posttrial. Neuromuscular performance (reactive-strength index, vertical jump height, absolute and relative peak power output, and negative vertical displacement) and sprint performance (15 and 30 m) were measured at pretrial, half-time, 90 min, and posttrial. Caffeine gum attenuated declines in reaction time (pre: 90.8 ± 0.8 AU to post: 90.7 ± 0.8 AU) by a further 4.2% than placebo (pre: 92.1 ± 0.8 AU to post: 88.2 ± 0.8 AU; p < .01). Caffeine gum reduced composure by 4.7% (pre: 69.1 ± 0.8 AU to post: 65.9 ± 0.8 AU) versus placebo (pre: 68.8 ± 0.8 AU to post: 68.3 ± 0.8 AU; p < .01). Caffeine gum did not influence any other variables (p > .05). Where caffeine gum is consumed by players prior to extra-time, reaction time increases but composure may be compromised, and neuromuscular and sprint performance remain unchanged. Future work should assess caffeine gum mixes with substances like L-theanine that promote a relaxed state under stressful conditions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Field A; Corr L; Birdsey L; Langley C; Marshall B; Wood G; Hearris M; Martinho D; Carbry C; Naughton R; Fleming J; Mohr M; Krustrup P; Russell M; David Harper L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/ijsnem.2023-0220 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Soccer/physiology\r\nMale\r\n*Caffeine/administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\n*Cross-Over Studies\r\n*Reaction Time/drug effects\r\nYoung Adult\r\n*Athletic Performance/physiology\r\nAdult\r\nChewing Gum\r\nexercise physiology\r\nfatigue\r\nfootball\r\nnutritional intervention\r\nperceptual-cognitive processing\r\nphysical performance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Field A, Corr L, Birdsey L, Langley C, Marshall B, Wood G, Hearris M, Martinho D, Carbry C, Naughton R, Fleming J, Mohr M, Krustrup P, Russell M, and David Harper L (2024) Caffeine Gum Improves Reaction Time but Reduces Composure Versus Placebo During the Extra-Time Period of Simulated Soccer Match-Play in Male Semiprofessional Players..

However, no previous investigation has tested the effectiveness of caffeinated chewing gum as the form of caffeine administration for judoists. The main goal of this study was to assess the effect of acute ingestion of a caffeinated chewing gum on the results of the special judo fitness test (SJFT). METHODS: Nine male elite judo athletes of the Polish national team (23.7 ± 4.4 years, body mass: 73.5 ± 7.4 kg) participated in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled and double-blind experiment. Participants were moderate caffeine consumers (3.1 mg/kg/day). Each athlete performed three identical experimental sessions after: (a) ingestion of two non-caffeinated chewing gums (P + P); (b) a caffeinated chewing gum and a placebo chewing gum (C + P; ~2.7 mg/kg); (c) two caffeinated chewing gums (C + C; ~5.4 mg/kg). Each gum was ingested 15 min before performing two Special Judo Fitness Test (SJFT) which were separated by 4 min of combat activity. RESULTS: The total number of throws was not different between P + P, C + P, and C + C (59.66 ± 4.15, 62.22 ± 4.32, 60.22 ± 4.08 throws, respectively; p = 0.41). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated no significant substance × time interaction effect as well as no main effect of caffeine for SJFT performance, SJFT index, blood lactate concentration, heart rate or rating of perceived exertion. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that the use of caffeinated chewing gum in a dose up to 5.4 mg/kg of caffeine did not increase performance during repeated SJFTs.","Comments":"2021-07-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Filip-Stachnik A; Krawczyk R; Krzysztofik M; Rzeszutko-Belzowska A; Dornowski M; Zajac A; Del Coso J; Wilk M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12970-021-00448-y","Keywords":"caffeine\r\ncentral stimulant agent\r\nlactic acid\r\nplacebo\r\nathlete\r\nathletic performance\r\nblood\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nfitness\r\nheart rate\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmartial art\r\nphysiology\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Filip-Stachnik A, Krawczyk R, Krzysztofik M, Rzeszutko-Belzowska A, Dornowski M, Zajac A, Del Coso J, and Wilk M (2021) Effects of acute ingestion of caffeinated chewing gum on performance in elite judo athletes.

Our study investigated the association of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), histamine, diamine oxidase (DAO), thyroxine and pyridoxine and the severity of NVP symptoms and assessed the efficacy of a vitamin C-containing chewing gum as a potential NVP treatment. Methods: In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 111 participants were assigned to receive vitamin C-containing chewing gum, placebo gum, or no treatment at two follow-ups during early pregnancy. Maternal serum levels of hCG, histamine, DAO, thyroxine, and pyridoxine were measured and correlated with NVP severity using the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE-24) score. Results: Elevated maternal hCG levels were significantly associated with an increased PUQE-24 score (p < 0.001), while histamine levels showed no significant correlation (p = 0.68). Maternal DAO levels negatively correlated with NVP symptoms (p < 0.001) and elevated thyroxine (p < 0.001) and pyridoxine levels (p < 0.001) were associated with increased PUQE-24 scores. The vitamin C-containing chewing gum did not demonstrate efficacy in alleviating NVP symptoms compared to placebo gum or no treatment during the first (p = 0.62) and second follow-up visits (p = 0.87). Conclusions: Our study underscores the complexity of factors contributing to NVP, highlighting the significant roles of hCG and DAO, while histamine levels appear unrelated. Maternal thyroxine and pyridoxine levels also significantly correlate with NVP symptoms. Vitamin C-containing chewing gum was not effective as a treatment for NVP.

Preliminary evidence in adults suggests that chewing gum plays a role in accelerating the return of postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, evidence is scarce in the paediatric population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chewing gum has benefits for children. Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases for randomised controlled trials that compare gum chewing with standard care after elective surgery in children from 1st Jan 2005 to 31st July 2021. We assessed the identified trials for quality and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022358801). The main outcome measures examined were time to flatus and stool postoperatively, time to tolerate oral intake, and length of hospital stay, which were analysed using fixed effects models. We also examined clinical complication rates and postoperative pain control. Results: We included six eligible trials, with a total of 357 enrolled patients. The intervention was well tolerated without complications. There was no significant difference in time to flatus (−2.86 h; 95 % CI: −6.2 to 0.47 h, p = 0.09), time to stool (−6.39 h; 95 % CI: −13.9 to 1.2 h, p = 0.1), time to tolerate oral intake (−0.03 days; 95 % CI: −0.15 to 0.1 days, p = 0.68), and length of hospital stay (0.08 days; 95 % CI: −0.07 to 0.22 days, p = 0.29). Postoperative pain control (opioid consumption, pain score, nausea score) was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Current evidence demonstrates that gum chewing is not associated with earlier postoperative gastrointestinal recovery in children. Future adequately powered and well-designed trials are necessary to evaluate any clinical benefit of chewing gum for children and whether it could result differences in healthcare satisfaction.

This study critically examined the current advice provided by UK hospitals to patients about post-operative care. Method Post-tonsillectomy patient advice sheets were obtained from 110 UK National Health Service trusts and equivalent organisations. Their contents were analysed and compared with published literature to determine whether the advice being given to patients was evidence-based. Results Post-tonsillectomy dietary and fluid intake advice varied between hospitals; although many recommended eating and drinking a normal diet (88 per cent), some recommended eating 'hard' (26 per cent) or 'soft' (8 per cent) foods. Non-evidence based advice given included avoiding fizzy drinks (21 per cent), fruit juices (9 per cent) and using chewing gum (51 per cent). Reported post-operative risks and safety-netting also varied. Conclusion Much of the advice in the available printed information appeared to be anecdotal and not based on, or was contrary to, published evidence. After review of the literature, an evidence-based post-tonsillectomy patient advice sheet was generated for dissemination.","Comments":"2022-12-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gabrawi M; Haymes A; Davis J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1017/S0022215121004527","Keywords":"acetylsalicylic acid\r\nibuprofen\r\nparacetamol\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbleeding\r\nchewing gum\r\nchild\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndietary intake\r\ndietary supplement\r\nfluid intake\r\nfruit juice\r\nhuman\r\norganization\r\notalgia\r\npain\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative hemorrhage\r\nsensory dysfunction\r\nsurgical risk\r\ntonsillectomy\r\nvisual disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gabrawi M, Haymes A, and Davis J (2022) Post-tonsillectomy advice: the UK patient experience.

Chewing gum can stimulate gut motility and enhanced instructions can improve the quality of bowel preparation. The objective of this study was to investigate whether chewing gum combined with WeChat-enhanced instruction can increase the quality of bowel preparation in constipated patients. Methods: This was a single-center, endoscopist-blinded, randomized–controlled trial. Patients were assigned (1:1) to the chewing gum and WeChat-enhanced instruction (CGW) group and the control group. Patients in both groups received 3 L of polyethylene glycol (PEG) before colonoscopy. Patients in the CGW group were asked to chew one piece of gum for 20 min after drinking each 1 L of PEG and received enhanced instruction via WeChat the day before colonoscopy. The quality of the bowel preparation (primary outcome), adenoma and/or polyp detection rate (ADR/PDR), number of polyps and/or adenomas, procedure time, and adverse events were compared. Results: A total of 115 patients were finally analysed, including 60 in the CGW group and 55 in the control group. The proportion of adequate bowel preparation and the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score were not statistically different between the two groups (76.7% vs 70.9%; 6.80 ± 1.42 vs 6.40 ± 1.78; both P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the ADR/PDR and number of polyps and/or adenomas (both P > 0.05). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of nausea in the CGW group than in the control group (33.3% vs 16.4%, P ¼ 0.036). Conclusions: Chewing gum combined with WeChat-enhanced instruction does not improve the quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy in constipated patients but does increase the incidence of nausea.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao C; Zou D; Wang W; Li Y; Han J; Su D; Qi X; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/gastro/goaf034","Keywords":"NCT05447403\r\nlaxative\r\nmacrogol\r\nxylitol\r\nabdominal pain\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbloating\r\nchewing gum\r\ncolon diverticulosis\r\ncolonoscopy\r\ncolorectal adenoma\r\ncolorectal polyp\r\nconstipation\r\ncontrolled study\r\nendoscopist\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nintestine preparation\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\nnausea\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsocial media\r\ntime\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao C, Zou D, Wang W, Li Y, Han J, Su D, and Qi X (2025) Effect of chewing gum combined with WeChat-enhanced instruction on bowel preparation in constipated patients: a randomized–controlled trial.

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing cesarean section. INTERVENTIONS: Coffee consumption and gum chewing for postoperative bowel function recovery. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes included the time to first defecation, first flatus, and first bowel sound postoperatively. Secondary outcomes comprised the time to first feeling of hunger, time to first toleration of food, length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and patient satisfaction. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 2,876 patients were included. Four studies compared coffee consumption to a control group, while sixteen studies compared gum chewing to a control group. Compared to the control group, the coffee group demonstrated a significant reduction in the time to first defecation (mean difference [95% CI]: - 4.4 [-5.97, - 2.91]; I2 = 39%; p < 0.00001) and the time to first flatus (mean difference [95% CI]: - 4.59 [-5.67, - 3.51]; I2 = 48%; p < 0.00001). Similarly, the gum chewing group showed significant reductions compared to the control group in the time to first defecation (mean difference [95% CI]: - 8.04 [-11.49, - 4.58]; I2 = 98%; p < 0.00001), first flatus (mean difference [95% CI]: - 7.52 [-10.14, - 4.90]; I2 = 98%; p < 0.00001), and first bowel sound (mean difference [95% CI]: - 4.67 [-7.29, - 2.06]; I2 = 99%; p < 0.00001). However, network meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between the coffee and gum chewing groups in these three outcomes. Additionally, coffee consumption significantly reduced the time to first toleration of food, whereas gum chewing did not shorten the time to first feeling of hunger or first toleration of food. Compared to the control group, gum chewing, but not coffee consumption, was associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay. Furthermore, gum chewing reduced the incidence of complications and improved patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Gum chewing is more effective than coffee consumption in promoting postoperative bowel function recovery. However, both interventions are superior to the control group in reducing the time to first defecation and first flatus.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gao T; Liu Q; Wang H; Liu J; Jin Y; Liu J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JS9.0000000000002911","Keywords":"article\r\ncesarean section\r\ncoffee\r\ncoffee consumption\r\ncomplication\r\ndefecation\r\ndiagnosis\r\ndrug therapy\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nhunger\r\nincidence\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine sound\r\nmastication\r\nmeta analysis\r\nnetwork meta-analysis\r\npatient satisfaction\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gao T, Liu Q, Wang H, Liu J, Jin Y, and Liu J (2025) The effects of coffee vs. Gum chewing after cesarean on bowel functions: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

There are many different reasons for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction such as stress response, perioperative interventions, bowel manipulation and so on. The mechanism of enhanced recovery from postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction with the help of chewing gum is believed to be the cephalic-vagal stimulation of digestion which increases the promotability of neural and humoral factors that act on different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, there were a series of randomized controlled trials to confirm the role of chewing gum in the recovery of gastrointestinal function. The results suggested that chewing gum enhanced early recovery of bowel function following abdominal surgery expect the gastrointestinal surgery.

In addition, most previous studies were after colorectal or gynecology surgery, whereas few reports focused on the effect of gum-chewing after gastrectomy. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of gumchewing on postoperative bowel function in patients who had undergone laparoscopic gastrectomy. Methods: From March 2014 to March 2016, 75 patients with gastric cancer received elective laparoscopic surgery in Shanghai Tongji hospital and were postoperatively randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 in a gum-chewing (Gum) group and 37 in a control (No gum) group. The patients in the Gum group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily, each time for at least 15 minutes, until the day of postoperative exhaust defecation. Results: The mean time to first flatus (83.4±35.6 vs. 79.2±24.2 hours; P=0.554) and the mean time to first defecation (125.7± 41.2 vs. 115.4±34.2 hours; P=0.192) were no different between the no gum and Gum groups. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative ileus (P=0.896) and postoperative hospital stay (P=0.109) between the 2 groups. The postoperative pain score at 48hours (P=0.032) in the Gum group was significantly higher than in the no gum group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in regards to patient demographics, comorbidities, duration of surgery, complications, and nausea/vomiting score. Conclusion: Gum-chewing after laparoscopic gastrectomy did not hasten the return of gastrointestinal function. In addition, gumchewing may increase patient pain on the second postoperative day.","Comments":"2017-05-17","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ge B; Zhao H; Lin R; Wang J; Chen Q; Liu L; Huang Q; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MD.0000000000006501","Keywords":"ChiCTR-TRC-14004287\r\nadult\r\naged\r\narticle\r\natelectasis\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncongestive heart failure\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\nelective surgery\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\ngastrectomy\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nliver abscess\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\npain assessment\r\npleura effusion\r\npneumonia\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\npostoperative pain\r\npostoperative period\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nstomach cancer\r\nsurgical infection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ge B, Zhao H, Lin R, Wang J, Chen Q, Liu L, and Huang Q (2017) Influence of gum-chewing on postoperative bowel activity after laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer: A randomized controlled trial.

Conclusions: This study revealed that 18 weeks of gum chewing with Olibanum did not change the neuropsychological status. More clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Comments":"2024-04-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ghorat F; Sepidarkish M; Saadattalab F; Rezghi M; Shahrestani S; Gholamalizadeh M; Doaei S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/npr2.12398","Keywords":"IRCT2017060918951N3\r\nbiodent\r\nfrankincense\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nAlzheimer disease\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease severity\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug efficacy\r\nfemale\r\nGeriatric Depression Scale\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nMini Mental State Examination\r\nneuropsychological assessment\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nWechsler memory scale\r\nbiodent","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ghorat F, Sepidarkish M, Saadattalab F, Rezghi M, Shahrestani S, Gholamalizadeh M, and Doaei S (2024) The clinical efficacy of Olibanum gum chewing in patients with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer disease: A randomized Parallel-Design controlled trial.

Altogether, 120 patients undergoing elective gynecologic laparoscopy were randomly divided into 2 groups of 60 each (final numbers: 53 controls, 56 patients). Controls underwent a routine postoperative regimen. Starting 6 hour after surgery, study patients chewed mint-flavored, sugarless xylitol gum until flatus occurred thrice a day. Other postoperative management was routine. First bowel sounds, first flatus, first bowel movement, and discharge times were recorded. Symptoms included abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. First flatus and first bowel sounds occurred significantly (P<0.001) earlier in the study patients. No significant differences were found for first defecation time, hospitalization duration, or mild/severe intestinal obstruction (all P>0.05). Thus, xylitol gum chewing after laparoscopy can effectively shorten the time to first flatus and helps with postoperative gastrointestinal functional recovery.

Fasting as per ASA guidelines is recommended prior to these procedures. However, the effect of chewing gum on fasting status has been a subject of debate and often leads to procedural delays. Objective: Evaluation of the effect of chewing gum on the gastric volume and pH. Methods: In this randomized controlled prospective observer blinded trail, ASA I–III patients aged more than 18 years scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or a combined EGD and colonoscopy under conscious sedation were studied. Patients randomized to the chewing gum group (Group-C) were allowed to chew gum until just before the start of their procedure; the remaining patients were included into Group-NC. After sedation and endoscope insertion, stomach contents were aspirated under vision of a gastroenterologist (blinded to groups). Results: Volume and pH of gastric contents aspirated from 67 patients (34 in Group-C and 33 in Group-NC) were analyzed. The demographic parameters of the groups were comparable. Gastric volume (median-interquartile range) was statistically higher in Group-C (13 ml (7.75–40.75) vs Group-NC 6 ml (1.00–14.00) (P < 0.001)]. The mean pH in both groups was comparable: 2.84 ± 2.11 in Group-C and 3.79 ± 2.53 in Group-NC (P = 0.141). Conclusion: Although our results show gastric volume in patients chewing gum was statistically higher, clinical relevance of such a small difference is questionable. Thus patients who chewed gum inadvertently prior to procedure should not be denied or delayed administration of sedative and anesthetic medications. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goudra B G; Singh P M; Carlin A; Manjunath A K; Reihmer J; Gouda G B; Ginsberg G G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goudra B G, Singh P M, Carlin A, Manjunath A K, Reihmer J, Gouda G B, and Ginsberg G G (2015) Effect of Gum Chewing on the Volume and pH of Gastric Contents: A Prospective Randomized Study.

In this study, the effect of postoperative gum chewing and decaffeinated coffee consumption on intestinal motility was tested in full-term caesarean sections without complication with a prospective, randomised controlled trial. Material and Method: 100 women who underwent caesarean section without a complication were divided into 4 groups using the simple randomisation method: Group 1 (women given sugar-free gum at 4-hour intervals after postoperative hour 2 until defaecation) n:25; Group 2 (women given 100 mL coffee at 4-hour intervals beginning from postoperative hour 2 until defaecation for three times a day) n:25; Group 3 (Sham group—women given 100 ml hot water at 4-hour intervals beginning from postoperative hour 2 until defaecation for three times a day) n:25; and Group 4 (control group) n:25. Time to sensation of first bowel movement and time to passage of first flatus and defaecation were compared between the groups. Results: Times to sensation of first bowel movement and passage of first flatus were significantly shorter in Group 1 compared to the sham and control groups. Time to first defaecation was also detected to be significantly shorter in Groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to the control group. No significant difference could be detected between the groups. Discussion: Sugar-free gum chewing and decaffeinated coffee consumption during postoperative period after caesarean section may decrease the time to first flatulence and defaecation and thus, the hospitalisation time.","Comments":"2017-11-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Göymen A; Şimşek Y; Özkaplan Ş E; Özdurak H İ; Akpak Y K; Semiz A; Oral S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4328/JCAM.4901","Keywords":"hot water\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nfluid intake\r\ngastrointestinal transit\r\nhuman\r\nintestine motility\r\nlength of stay\r\nmajor clinical study\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsensation\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Göymen A, Şimşek Y, Özkaplan Ş E, Özdurak H İ, Akpak Y K, Semiz A, and Oral S (2017) Effect of gum chewing and coffee consumption on intestinal motility in caesarean sections.

Supplementation with caffeine has been shown to acutely enhance various aspects of exercise performance in many but not all studies. Small to moderate benefits of caffeine use include, but are not limited to: muscular endurance, movement velocity and muscular strength, sprinting, jumping, and throwing performance, as well as a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic sport-specific actions. 2. Aerobic endurance appears to be the form of exercise with the most consistent moderate-to-large benefits from caffeine use, although the magnitude of its effects differs between individuals. 3. Caffeine has consistently been shown to improve exercise performance when consumed in doses of 3-6 mg/kg body mass. Minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2 mg/kg body mass. Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. 9 mg/kg) are associated with a high incidence of side-effects and do not seem to be required to elicit an ergogenic effect. 4. The most commonly used timing of caffeine supplementation is 60 min pre-exercise. Optimal timing of caffeine ingestion likely depends on the source of caffeine. For example, as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session. 5. Caffeine appears to improve physical performance in both trained and untrained individuals. 6. Inter-individual differences in sport and exercise performance as well as adverse effects on sleep or feelings of anxiety following caffeine ingestion may be attributed to genetic variation associated with caffeine metabolism, and physical and psychological response. Other factors such as habitual caffeine intake also may play a role in between-individual response variation. 7. Caffeine has been shown to be ergogenic for cognitive function, including attention and vigilance, in most individuals. 8. Caffeine may improve cognitive and physical performance in some individuals under conditions of sleep deprivation. 9. The use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6 mg/kg and 4-6 mg/kg, respectively. 10. Alternative sources of caffeine such as caffeinated chewing gum, mouth rinses, energy gels and chews have been shown to improve performance, primarily in aerobic exercise. 11. Energy drinks and pre-workout supplements containing caffeine have been demonstrated to enhance both anaerobic and aerobic performance.","Comments":"2021-09-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guest N S; VanDusseldorp T A; Nelson M T; Grgic J; Schoenfeld B J; Jenkins N D.M; Arent S M; Antonio J; Stout J R; Trexler E T; Smith-Ryan A E; Goldstein E R; Kalman D S; Campbell B I; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4","Keywords":"adenosine A2a receptor\r\nADORA2A protein, human\r\ncaffeine\r\nCYP1A2 protein, human\r\ncytochrome P450 1A2\r\nperformance enhancing substance\r\nanxiety\r\nathletic performance\r\nchewing gum\r\ncognition\r\ndoping\r\ndose calculation\r\ndrug effect\r\nendurance\r\nenergy drink\r\nexercise\r\ngenetics\r\nheat\r\nhuman\r\nmedical society\r\nmetabolism\r\nmicrocapsule\r\nmovement (physiology)\r\nmuscle strength\r\nnutrition\r\nnutritional science\r\nphysiology\r\nskeletal muscle\r\nsleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guest N S, VanDusseldorp T A, Nelson M T, Grgic J, Schoenfeld B J, Jenkins N D.M, Arent S M, Antonio J, Stout J R, Trexler E T, Smith-Ryan A E, Goldstein E R, Kalman D S, and Campbell B I (2021) International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance.

POI is a major concern for surgeons because it increases hospital stay, the cost of care, and postoperative morbidity in patients who have undergone extensive gynecological oncological surgery.

The present review summarizes the current evidence on non-pharmacological interventions, including coffee consumption and chewing gum, used to prevent and treat POI.

Nursing practice to lessen labor pain may be significantly impacted by the application of a nonpharmacologic treatment. Aim: Evaluate the effect of gum chewing and cold therapy on postoperative cesarean women’s self-assessed pain levels and narcotics use. Method: A Quasi Experimental intervention design was used in the study at inpatient units of Dar Sahet Elmar`Aa hospital that follow Egypt healthcare authority in Port Said city. Purposive sample of 159 pregnant women who enrolled randomly in the three parallel groups. Two tools were used for collecting data in the study as A self-Administered questionnaire and the visual analog scale (VAS) were used. Results: The overall mean VAS score among the Cold pack gel group was 4.216 ± 0.716, Gum chewing group was 4.314 ± 0.908, while control group was 5.714 ± 1.232 with statistically significance differences among groups. Furthermore, over one quarter in cold therapy group, less than one quarter in Gum chewing group (32.1 and 28.3%, respectively) stopped taking analgesics 24 h after surgery, compared to only 7.5% of control group. Conclusion: Cold pack gel and gum chewing offer simple and cost-effective alternatives for postoperative pain management; however, cold pack gel has been shown to be substantially more effective in improving pain scores at four, eight, twelve, and twenty-four hours after surgery. In addition to its impact on reducing the need for opioid prescription drugs. Trial Registration Number (TRN).

Previous studies have linked a higher dose of nicotine in nicotine replacement therapy to a higher success rate for smoking cessation. Thus, this study was performed to compare relief of urges to smoke, up until 5 h following treatment with a new 6 mg nicotine gum versus currently marketed 4 mg nicotine gum. Methods: This was a randomized crossover clinical study. Following 12 h of abstinence from smoking, either one 6 mg or one 4 mg nicotine gum was given to 240 healthy adult smokers. Thereafter, urges to smoke were scored on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale repeatedly over 5 h. Results: The reductions in urges to smoke over the first 1 and 3 h after administration were statistically significantly greater with 6 mg than 4 mg gum, (p < 0.005). A 50% reduction in perceived urges to smoke was reached in 9.4 min with 6 mg gum compared to 16.2 min with 4 mg gum (median values). The median duration of a 50% or more reduction in VAS urges to smoke score was 111 min with the 6 mg gum, versus 74 min for the 4 mg gum. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the 6 mg nicotine gum provided a greater reduction, faster and longer relief of urges to smoke than the 4 mg nicotine gum.

It is less certain if the same analgesic effects exist for children one year to 16 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2011 (Harrison 2011) titled Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle-related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of sweet tasting solutions or substances for reducing needle-related procedural pain in children beyond one year of age. Search methods: Searches were run to the end of June 2014. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ACP Journal Club (all via OvidSP), and CINAH (via EBSCOhost). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) in which children aged one year to 16 years, received a sweet tasting solution or substance for needle-related procedural pain. Control conditions included water, non-sweet tasting substances, pacifier, distraction, positioning/containment, breastfeeding, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis: Outcome measures included crying duration, composite pain scores, physiological or behavioral pain indicators, self-report of pain or parental or healthcare professional-report of the child's pain. We reported mean differences (MD), weighted mean difference (WMD), or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect or random-effects models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We reported risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the I2 statistic to assess between-study heterogeneity. Main results: We included one unpublished and seven published studies (total of 808 participants); four more studies and 478 more participants than the 2011 review. Six trials included young children aged one to four years receiving sucrose or candy lollypops for immunisation pain compared with water or no treatment. Usual care included topical anaesthetics, upright parental holding, and distraction. All studies were well designed blinded RCTs, however, five of the six studies had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Two studies included school-aged children receiving sweet or unsweetened chewing gum before, or before and during, immunisation and blood collection. Both studies, conducted by the same author, had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Results for the toddlers/pre-school children were conflicting. Duration of cry, using a random-effects model, was not significantly reduced by sweet taste (six trials, 520 children, WMD -15 seconds, 95% CI -54 to 24, I2 = 94%). Composite pain score at time of first needle was reported in four studies (n = 121 children). The scores were not significantly different between the sucrose and control group (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.75, I2 = 86%). A Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale score > 4 was significantly less common in the sucrose group compared to the control group in one study (n = 472, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.20; NNTB 3, 95% CI 3 to 5; tests for heterogeneity not applicable. For school-aged children, chewing sweet gum before needle-related painful procedures (two studies, n = 111 children) or during the procedures (two studies, n = 103 children) did not significantly reduce pain scores. A comparison of the Faces Pain Scale scores in children chewing sweet gum before the procedures compared with scores of children chewing unsweetened gum revealed a WMD of -0.15 (95% CI -0.61 to 0.30). Similar results were found when comparing the chewing of sweet gum with unsweetened gum during the procedure (WMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.74). The Colored Analogue Scale for children chewing sweet gum compared to unsweetened gum before the procedure was not significantly different (WMD 0.24 (-0.69 to 1.18)) nor was it different when children chewed the gum during the procedure (WMD 0.86 (95% CI -0.12 to 1.83)). There was no heterogeneity for any of these analyses in school-aged children (I2 = 0%). Authors' conclusions: Based on the eight studies included in this systematic review update, two of which were subgroups of small numbers of eligible toddlers from larger studies, and three of which were pilot RCTs with small numbers of participants, there is insufficient evidence of the analgesic effects of sweet tasting solutions or substances during acutely painful procedures in young children between one and four years of age. Further rigorously conducted, adequately powered RCTs are warranted in this population. Based on the two studies by the same author, there was no evidence of analgesic effects of sweet taste in school-aged children. As there are other effective evidence-based strategies available to use in this age group, further trials are not warranted. Despite the addition of four studies in this review, conclusions have not changed since the last version of the review.","Comments":"2018-02-26","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Harrison D; Yamada J; Adams-Webber T; Ohlsson A; Beyene J; Stevens B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD008408.pub3","Keywords":"needle\r\npacifier\r\nfructose\r\nglucose\r\nlocal anesthetic agent\r\nsucrose\r\nsweetening agent\r\nwater\r\nairway obstruction\r\narterial oxygen saturation\r\nblood carbon dioxide tension\r\nblood oxygen tension\r\nbody movement\r\nbody position\r\nbradycardia\r\nbreast feeding\r\nbreathing rate\r\nchewing gum\r\nChildren Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale\r\nColored Analogue Scale\r\ncrying\r\nFaces Pain Scale\r\nfacial expression\r\nfatty acid desaturation\r\nheart rate\r\nheart rate variability\r\nhuman\r\nimmunization\r\npain assessment\r\npain intensity\r\npriority journal\r\nprocedural pain\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nskin conductance\r\nsystematic review\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Harrison D, Yamada J, Adams-Webber T, Ohlsson A, Beyene J, and Stevens B (2015) Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle-related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years.

Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no NRT' interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search is July 2017. Selection criteria: Randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared NRT to placebo or to no treatment. We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews. Data collection and analysis: Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Main results: We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare. Authors' conclusions: There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hartmann-Boyce J; Chepkin S C; Ye W; Bullen C; Lancaster T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hartmann-Boyce J, Chepkin S C, Ye W, Bullen C, and Lancaster T (2018) Nicotine replacement therapy versus control for smoking cessation.

However, it remains controversial how the taste and odour properties of chewing gum influence stress. The present study was designed to investigate this issue in human subjects. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we tested salivary cortisol concentration, which is thought to be a stress marker, in 96 adults who chewed gum with different combinations of taste and odour. Subjects could discriminate between the types of gum without prior information. Salivary cortisol concentrations were highest and lowest for the subjects who chewed the most flavourful gum and the least flavourful gum, respectively. These findings suggest that the salivary cortisol level during gum chewing is not a marker of negative emotions (i.e., stressful conditions) as traditionally considered but, rather, an index of positive emotions that can facilitate biological responses to overcome stressful conditions.","Comments":"2017-04-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hasegawa Y; Tachibana Y; Ono T; Kishimoto H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0173475","Keywords":"000017039\r\nhydrocortisone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nemotion\r\nenzyme linked immunosorbent assay\r\nfemale\r\nflavor\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nhydrocortisone release\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nnormal human\r\nodor\r\nsaliva level\r\nphysiological stress\r\ntaste","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hasegawa Y, Tachibana Y, Ono T, and Kishimoto H (2017) Flavour-enhanced cortisol release during gum chewing.

Mothers undergoing caesarean need more care and attention than mothers undergoing normal vaginal delivery and the time needed for recovery of post cesarean section women is more than those needed for vaginal delivery. Aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of post cesarean section protocol of care on early and follow up outcomes. Design: randomized controlled trail (Parallel group design) RCT (NCT05300750). Methods: random sample of 150 mothers were randomly allocated into three groups; two intervention groups and one control group 50 for each group. The mothers who underwent cesarean birth were divided into 3 groups by using permuted blocks of different sizes (3, 6, and 9), depending on the use of two different methods of gum chewing, early oral hydration, with early mobilization. Only standard of care was applied to the mothers in the control group. Three tools were utilized for data collection; structured interviewing questionnaire schedule, post cesarean section early assessment sheet and post cesarean section follow up assessment sheet. Results: The intestinal sounds were heard earlier, time of passing gas was earlier, and intestinal movements were earlier in the oral fluid group as compared to the other two groups (p < 0.05). Seventy percent of mothers in the oral fluid group passed flatus at 6 hrs as compared to 62% of mothers in the chewing gum group and 4% of mothers in the control group with statistical significant differences between the two interventions groups and the control group (P< 0.001). Mothers in the oral fluid group had shorter hospital stay duration than mothers in the chewing gum group and mothers in the control group as a primary outcome. In relation to follow up outcomes: as wound infection in the three groups, findings revealed no statistical difference between the three groups. Chewing gum shows the best outcome in relation to wound infection and hospital readmission. Conclusion: Fluid intake and chewing gum besides early ambulation as a protocol of care for mothers who had cesarean section may had a better maternal outcome manifested as early resumption of intestinal movements, passing flatus and short hospital stay.","Comments":"2022-07-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hassan E S.A.E.E; El Kader S H.A; Fawaz M A; Sayed A M; Ghani R M.A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.14704/nq.2022.20.6.NQ22604","Keywords":"NCT05300750\r\nstethoscope\r\nsuture\r\npeppermint\r\nabdominal distension\r\nadult\r\nanise\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nbleeding\r\nburning sensation\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\nconstipation\r\ncontrolled study\r\nsomnolence\r\ndyspnea\r\ndysuria\r\nepidural anesthesia\r\nfemale\r\nfever\r\nflatulence\r\nfluid intake\r\nfollow up\r\nhospital readmission\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nhydration\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine sound\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmicturition\r\nmobilization\r\nmother\r\noutcome assessment\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsepsis\r\nurinary tract infection\r\nvagina bleeding\r\nvagina discharge (disease)\r\nvaginal delivery\r\nvenous thromboembolism\r\nvomiting\r\nwound infection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hassan E S.A.E.E, El Kader S H.A, Fawaz M A, Sayed A M, and Ghani R M.A (2022) Effect of Post Cesarean Section Protocol of Care on Early and Follow up Outcomes.

Methods: The current randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced crossover study compared the effects of a functional gum containing Rhodiola rosea and B-vitamins to flavour-matched regular chewing gum and a flavour-matched placebo. Thirty-six healthy young participants completed measures of attention and mood at baseline, during chewing, and 1-h after chewing. Results: Chewing both functional and regular gum was shown to reduce errors on a digit vigilance task compared to placebo irrespective of whether measured during or after chewing. There were no benefits to adding functional ingredients to the gum. Discussion: Future chewing research should consider different formats of placebo. Sex differences in response to chewing and the impact of rate and intensity of chewing should also be explored. Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05544500. © 2024 The Author(s).

Background: GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and defecatory difficulties are bothersome for women following a caesarean delivery. There is category A recommendation to not withhold oral intake postoperatively. However, current practice guidelines vary widely on time to initiate oral feeding post caesarean delivery, and additional research is needed. Gum chewing has been shown to stimulate the GI system in other postoperative patient populations. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: An electronic review was undertaken using the following resources: PubMed (Medline), CINAHL, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Key words used in various combinations included cesarean section; cesarean delivery; postoperative chewing gum; bowel movement; bowel function and complications. Results: A total of 171 articles were found of which 166 were excluded: 157 were duplicates and the remainder did not meet the inclusion criteria. Five randomised control trials were included in the meta-analysis, focusing on gum chewing as an intervention as compared with a nongum chewing intervention, with a total of 846 participants. Compared with the nongum chewing group, gum chewing showed a beneficial impact on the major outcomes of digestive system activation, including bowel sound, gas passage and defecation. Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports the effectiveness of gum chewing post caesarean delivery as a noninvasive/nonpharmacological intervention for reactivation of bowel movement. Relevance to clinical practice: Gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period following caesarean delivery may provide a socially acceptable, low-cost and safe intervention to reduce postcaesarean delivery GI complications and restore GI function. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hochner H; Tenfelde S M; Abu Ahmad; W; Liebergall-Wischnitzer M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hochner H, Tenfelde S M, Abu Ahmad, W, and Liebergall-Wischnitzer M (2015) Gum chewing and gastrointestinal function following caesarean delivery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

The conflicting findings in the literature on this subject are because in part of the use of mixed study populations, which has led to difficulties in assessing the value of sham feeding in ameliorating this condition. Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of postsurgical gum chewing in restoring normal bowel movement in patients with colorectal cancer who had undergone abdominal surgery for colon resection. Methods A randomized controlled trial was used to examine the time to first postoperative flatus and defecation. The intervention group (n = 30) received xylitol chewing gum on the first day after colon resection, one piece of gum for 15 minutes, 3 times daily, until the time to first flatus and defecation. Both the intervention and control groups (n = 30) received standard postoperative care and were encouraged to walk as soon as possible after surgery. The time to first flatus was reported by patients. Results The time to first flatus and defecation in the intervention group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (39.13 ± 15.66 vs. 52.92 ± 21.97 hours and 54.55 ± 18.90 vs. 77.98 ± 34.59 hours, respectively). However, after controlling for age and surgical duration, only time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the intervention group. Significantly positive correlations were found between time to first flatus and time to first defecation in both groups. Conclusions/Implications for Practice In this study, gum chewing was shown to have a positive effect on the time to first postoperative flatus and defecation. This inexpensive and noninvasive intervention may be recommended to decrease the time to resolution of postsurgical ileus in middle-aged and older patients who have undergone open abdominal surgery for colorectal resection. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hsu Y C; Szu S Y; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hsu Y C, and Szu S Y (2022) Effects of Gum Chewing on Recovery From Postoperative Ileus: A Randomized Clinical Trail.

These affect maternal nutritional status, prolong recovery, extend hospitalization, increase medical costs, and lead to neonatal care challenges.This study is to examine the effects of different postoperative feeding protocols on the restoration of gastrointestinal function in women undergoing repeat cesarean section. Methods: A total of 103 women were randomly assigned to three groups: experimental group A (n = 35), experimental group B (n = 34), and a control group (n = 34). In group A, women without choking symptoms received a clear fluid diet postoperatively, followed by a pureed diet after 6 h, and a regular soft diet after passing flatus. In group B, women chewed gum postoperatively, followed by a clear fluid diet after 2 h, a pureed diet after 6 h, and a regular soft diet after passing flatus. The control group received a clear fluid diet, a pureed diet after passing flatus, and a regular soft diet after defecation. Outcomes measured included recovery of gastrointestinal function, blood biochemical markers, comfort level, exclusive breastfeeding rate, and newborn weight loss. Results: The baseline maternal data across the three groups demonstrated no significant differences (P > 0.05). Both experimental groups A and B showed earlier recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function compared to the control group, though there was no significant difference between the two experimental groups (P > 0.05). Additionally, postoperative comfort levels were significantly higher in both experimental groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Early feeding is safe and effective for women who underwent repeat cesarean sections.It has been shown to accelerate gastrointestinal recovery, significantly improve maternal comfort and satisfaction.In cases where immediate postoperative oral intake is not feasible, chewing gum demonstrates a comparable promotive effect, providing a viable substitute in facilitating recovery.

However, the efficacy remains unclear for women undergoing cesarean delivery. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of chewing gum for recovering intestinal function following cesarean delivery in the early postoperative period.

Two of the authors independently extracted data from the eligibility studies, and Review Manager Version 5.2 was used to pool the data. Finally, five randomized controlled trials involving 882 patients were included and all the trials were considered as at high risk of bias. The pooled findings showed that chewing gum after cesarean delivery can significantly shorten the time to first flatus [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.01 to-0.14; p<0.001]; time to first hearing of normal intestinal sounds (SMD=-0.69; 95% CI=-1.20 to-0.17; p=0.009; I2=92%). Time to the first defecation (SMD=-0.53; 95% CI=-1.61 to-0.07; p=0.07; I2=92%) and length of hospital stay (SMD=-0.59; 95% CI=-1.18 to 0.00; p=0.05; I2=93%) were also reduced in the chewing gum group; however, these results were not statistically significant.

Combined results indicated that body weight (WMD: -0.60 kg, 95 % CI: -1.13, -0.07, P = 0.026, I2 = 89 %), and WC (WMD: -1.36 cm, 95 % CI: -2.50, -0.22, P = 0.019, I2 = 96 %) changed significantly following gum consumption. Subgroup analyses showed that a gum dosage ≤15 g/day (WMD: -1.23 kg/m2, 95 % CI: -2.03 to -0.43, I2 = 99 %) significantly decreased BMI. Moreover, gum consumption had significant effects on cardiac disorders. Conclusion: In conclusion, gum supplementation may be an adjuvant for controlling obesity and can possess potential benefits in the management of cardiac disorders.","Comments":"2020-10-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang M; Luo J; Luo G; Berahmand F; Găman M A; Sedanur Macit; M; Zhang X; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102578","Keywords":"anthropometry\r\nbody mass\r\nbody weight\r\nchewing gum\r\ndisease association\r\ndisease control\r\nheart disease\r\nhuman\r\nobesity\r\npatient care\r\nreview\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang M, Luo J, Luo G, Berahmand F, Găman M A, Sedanur Macit, M, and Zhang X (2020) The effect of gum consumption on anthropometric characteristics and cardiac disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

We determined the effects of chewing gum early during SBCE on gastric transit time (GTT), SBTT, CR, DY, and gastroscopy intervention. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients (ages 16–80 years) undergoing SBCE between January and June 2019. Patients were randomized to a chewing gum group (103 patients) and a control group (102 patients). Patients in the former group chewed one piece of gum for ~15 min every 30 min during the first hour of SBCE. Two gastroenterologists blinded to the study group examined the data. Results: GTT was shorter in the chewing gum group (19.0 min, interquartile range: 17.0–52.0 min) than in the control group [42.5 min (23.25–60 min); P = 0.01].

Due to the importance of cognitive functioning for archery athletes, we investigated the effects of nicotine supplementation on the cognitive abilities, heart rate variability (HRV), and sport performance of professional archers. METHODS: Eleven college archers were recruited and given 2 mg of nicotine supplementation (NIC group) and placebo (PLA group) in a crossover design. RESULTS: The results showed that at 30 min after the intake of nicotine gum, the \"correct rejection\" time in the NIC group was significantly lower than that of the PLA group (7.29 ± 0.87 vs. 8.23 ± 0.98 msec, p < 0.05). In addition, the NIC group completed the grooved pegboard test in a shorter time than the PLA group (48.76 ± 3.18 vs. 53.41 ± 4.05 s, p < 0.05), whereas motor reaction times were not different between the two groups. Saliva α-amylase activity was significantly lower after nicotine supplementation (p < 0.01) but increased immediately after the archery test in the NIC group (p < 0.05). In addition, nicotine supplementation significantly decreased HRV and increased the archery score (290.58 ± 10.09 vs. 298.05 ± 8.56, p < 0.01).

It results in prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, delayed advancement in diet, and decreased patient satisfaction. Although there are multiple interventions to decrease POI, the use of chewing gum may improve patient outcomes at low cost with minimal side effects. This project compared the use of post-operative gum chewing on time to first flatus or defecation, rate of POI, and length of hospital stay among abdominal surgical patients over a period of 3 weeks to no intervention. A retrospective chart review for the two-month period prior to the intervention was conducted to obtain a control group. The target sample size was 51 for both control and treatment groups. The target was met for the control group, but only 24 patients were recruited for the treatment group. The treatment group included patients who underwent gynecological or colorectal surgery. The treatment group received chewing gum starting post-operative day one, three times a day. Patients chewed gum for thirty minutes until first flatus or defecation. Results revealed the mean time to first flatus was 2.3 (SD = 1.3) days in the control group and 1.5 (SD = 0.6) days in the treatment group. Time to first flatus was significantly reduced in the gum chewing group (p = .006). Gum chewers had a shorter time for first defecation (M = 2.13 days, SD = 0.84) than control group (M = 3.00 days, SD = 1.71).

Methods Intake from coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, gums, and medications was assessed. Associations between caffeine intake and demographic variables including sex, age, race/ethnicity, family income, general health, exercise, weight variables and tobacco use were examined. Reasons for use of caffeine-containing products were assessed. Results Caffeine, in any form, was consumed by 92% of students in the past year. Mean daily caffeine consumption for all students, including non-consumers, was 159 mg/d with a mean intake of 173 mg/d among caffeine users. Coffee was the main source of caffeine intake in male (120 mg/d) and female (111 mg/d) consumers. Male and female students consumed 53 vs. 30 mg/d of caffeine in energy drinks, respectively, and 28% consumed energy drinks with alcohol on at least one occasion. Students provided multiple reasons for caffeine use including: to feel awake (79%); enjoy the taste (68%); the social aspects of consumption (39%); improve concentration (31%); increase physical energy (27%); improve mood (18%); and alleviate stress (9%). Conclusions As in the general U.S. population, coffee is the primary source of caffeine intake among the college students surveyed. Energy drinks provide less than half of total daily caffeine intake but more than among the general population. Students, especially women, consume somewhat more caffeine than the general population of individuals aged 19–30 y but less than individuals aged 31–50 y.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mahoney Caroline R; Giles Grace E; Marriott Bernadette P; Judelson Daniel A; Glickman Ellen L; Geiselman Paula J; Lieberman Harris R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.clnu.2018.04.004","Keywords":"Caffeine Administration and Dosage\r\nStudents, College Psychosocial Factors\r\nGeographic Factors\r\nFood Intake\r\nHuman\r\nConvenience Sample\r\nUnited States\r\nSurveys\r\nCoffee\r\nTea\r\nCarbonated Beverages\r\nEnergy Drinks\r\nChewing Gum\r\nSex Factors\r\nAge Factors\r\nRace Factors\r\nEthnic Groups\r\nIncome\r\nFamily Characteristics\r\nHealth Status\r\nExercise\r\nBody Weight\r\nTobacco\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nAlcohols\r\nTaste\r\nAffect\r\nStress, Psychological Prevention and Control\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nMale\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mahoney Caroline R, Giles Grace E, Marriott Bernadette P, Judelson Daniel A, Glickman Ellen L, Geiselman Paula J, and Lieberman Harris R (    ) Intake of caffeine from all sources and reasons for use by college students..

The literature aims to present a brief outline of interventions for preventing and treating POI post-surgery. Data from 2014 to 2023 were gathered from reputable sources like PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria focused on studies exploring innovative treatments and prevention strategies for POI, using keywords such as novel POI treatments, non-pharmacological prevention, POI incidence rates, POI management, and risk factors. The findings revealed that integration of preventive measures such as coffee consumption, chewing gum, probiotics, and use of dikenchuto within enhanced recovery programs has significantly reduced both the frequency and duration of POI, without any adverse effects, with minimally invasive surgical approaches showing promise as an additional preventive strategy. While treatment options such as alvimopan, NSAIDs, and acupuncture have demonstrated efficacy, the use of lidocaine has raised concerns due to associated adverse effects. The ongoing exploration of novel therapeutic strategies such as targeting the mast cells, vagal nerve stimulation and tight junction protein, and prokinetic-mediated instigation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory trail not only holds promise for enhanced treatment but also deepens the understanding of intricate cellular and molecular pathways underlying POI. POI presents a complex challenge in various surgical specialties, necessitating a multifaceted management approach. The integration of preventive and treatment measures within enhanced recovery programs has significantly reduced POI frequency and duration.","Comments":"2024-06-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Iskander O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MD.0000000000038177","Keywords":"alvimopan\r\ninterleukin 6\r\nlidocaine\r\nprobiotic agent\r\ntight junction protein\r\nacupuncture\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee consumption\r\nelectroacupuncture\r\nexperimental therapy\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\ngynecologic surgery\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\ninfectious complication\r\nMedline\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npractice guideline\r\nreview\r\nsurgical approach\r\nsurgical infection\r\nsurgical stress\r\nsurgical wound\r\nsystematic review\r\nvagus nerve stimulation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Iskander O (2024) An outline of the management and prevention of postoperative ileus A review.

The use of mixed study populations has contributed to the conflicting findings in the literature on this subject, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of sham feeding in alleviating this condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of postsurgical gum chewing in restoring normal bowel movement in patients who had undergone abdominal surgeries. Materials and Methods: We used a randomized controlled trial to examine the time to first postoperative flatus and defecation. On the first day after the surgery, the intervention group (n = 8) received xylitol chewing gum, one piece for 15 minutes, three times daily, until they experienced their first postoperative flatus and defecation. Both the intervention and control groups (n = 8) received standard postoperative care and were encouraged to walk as soon as possible after surgery. Patients reported the time to the first flatus. Result: The time to first flatus and defecate in the intervention group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (39.13 ± 15.66 vs. 52.92 ± 21.97 hours and 54.55 ± 18.90 vs. 77.98 ± 34.59 hours, respectively). However, after adjusting for age and surgical duration, only time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the intervention group. Both groups showed significantly positive correlations between the time to first flatus and the time to first defecation. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a positive effect of gum chewing on the time to first postoperative flatus and defecation. We may recommend this inexpensive and noninvasive intervention to reduce the time to resolution of postsurgical ileus in individuals who have undergone open abdominal surgeries.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jayalal J A; Raj E K; Nickson J; Manikandan S; Paul J J.B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.47009/jamp.2025.7.3.30","Keywords":"analgesic agent\r\nnonsteroid antiinflammatory agent\r\nopiate\r\nxylitol\r\nabdominal surgery\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nglobal health\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nopen surgery\r\noperation duration\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nprophylaxis\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsham feeding\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsurgical patient\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jayalal J A, Raj E K, Nickson J, Manikandan S, and Paul J J.B (2025) EFFICACY OF CHEWING GUM IN REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE ILEUS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING OPEN ABDOMINAL SURGERIES.

Exclusion criteria included previous gastrointestinal surgery or preexisting gastrointestinal disease. Patients were randomized by coin flip. The treatment group chewed sugar-free bubble gum 5 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes beginning on postoperative day 1; the control group did not chew gum. Patients were asked a series of questions regarding subjective gastrointestinal symptoms each day. Time to flatus and first passage of feces were recorded as indicators of return to normal bowel function. Normality of data was assessed using normal probability plots. Results A total of 83 patients completed the study (69 females and 14 males; mean age, 14.4 years). Of the 42 patients in the chewing gum group, 8 elected to stop chewing gum regularly before discharge for to a variety of reasons. Patients who chewed gum experienced first bowel movement on average 145.9 hours after surgery, 30.9 hours before those who did not chew gum (p =.04). Gum-chewing patients first experienced flatus an average of 55.2 hours after surgery, compared with 62.3 hours for controls. This trend did not reach statistical significance (p =.12). No difference was noted in duration of hospital stay, medications administered as required, or subjective symptoms. Conclusion Chewing gum after posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis is safe and may speed return of normal bowel function. Chewing gum after surgical correction of scoliosis facilitates an earlier return to normal bowel function, which may improve patient satisfaction in the early postoperative period.","Comments":"2015-05-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jennings J K; Doyle J S; Gilbert S R; Conklin M J; Khoury J G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jspd.2014.12.001","Keywords":"adolescent\r\nadolescent idiopathic scoliosis\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\ngastrointestinal symptom\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npostoperative care\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nspine fusion","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jennings J K, Doyle J S, Gilbert S R, Conklin M J, and Khoury J G (2015) The use of chewing gum postoperatively in pediatric scoliosis patients facilitates an earlier return to normal bowel function.

The study was designed as a prospective randomised controlled study. We divided the patients into two groups regarding postoperative chewing gum after elective TLH operation. The demographic status and characteristics of the patients as well as, anaesthesia and operation records were obtained. The study group was asked to chew gum for 15 min in an hour starting from post-operative 4th hour until the patient passed flatus. In each patient, first auscultation of bowel sounds, first flatus and first defaecation time, as well as first mobilisation time and discharge time, were recorded. We compared the difference in abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting and post-operative ileus (POI) rates. Eight patients were excluded from the study due to matching with exclusion criteria. The remaining 126 patients were divided into two groups. First bowel sounds, first bowel movements, the timing of first gas discharge and the timing of the first defaecation was found significantly earlier in the given-chewing gum group (p <.001). The timing of patient discharge and POI were found to be similar in each group (p >.05). Mild symptoms of ileus were observed in two patients (3.2%) in the not given-chewing gum group and three patients (5.5%) in the given-chewing gum group. The symptoms were better tolerated by the patients who chew gums and no side effects regarding the treatment were observed. In post-operative patient care after minimally invasive surgery, chewing gum has a beneficial effect on bowel movements. This inexpensive and well-tolerated procedure ameliorates gastrointestinal (GI) functions, whereas it has little benefit on early mobilisation and timing of the patient discharge after patients undergoing TLH.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? There are many studies in the literature on the effect of gum on postoperative bowel movements, early mobilisation and short-term hospitalisation. However, there are still doubts about its use after minimally invasive surgery, especially in gynaecology practice. What do the results of this study add? Chewing gum after surgery is a well-tolerated, effective, safe, easy and convenient method and is easily accepted by patients. Its use by gynaecologists after TLH is still not clear. Our aim is to show the relationship between chewing gum and TLH with this study; We believe that early mobilisation after laparoscopic hysterectomy will not be of significant benefit after minimally invasive gynaecological surgeries as it is not significantly effective in early nutrition and early patient discharge. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our statistically not significant results obtained in this study may change after conducting randomised prospective studies involving more patients. However, we believe that giving chewing-gum after laparoscopic hysterectomy will not have a significant benefit.","Comments":"2022-09-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kadirogullari P; Seckin K D; Yalcin Bahat; P; Aytufan Z; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/01443615.2021.1941821","Keywords":"hemoglobin\r\nabdominal bleeding\r\nabdominal distension\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nauscultation\r\nbody mass\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\ndemography\r\nfemale\r\nhospital discharge\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine motility\r\nintestine sound\r\nlaparoscopic hysterectomy\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmiddle aged\r\nminimally invasive surgery\r\nmobilization\r\noperation duration\r\npostoperative analgesia\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative hemorrhage\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative infection\r\npostoperative nausea\r\npostoperative vomiting\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kadirogullari P, Seckin K D, Yalcin Bahat, P, and Aytufan Z (2022) The effect of chewing gum on bowel function postoperatively in patients with total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomised controlled trial.

This can negatively impact on the patient experience and on the quality of bowel preparation. This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess whether adjuncts to bowel preparation affected palatability, tolerability and quality of bowel preparation (bowel cleanliness). Methods: A systematic search strategy was conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify studies evaluating adjunct use for colonoscopic bowel preparation. Studies comparing different regimens and volumes were excluded. Specific outcomes studied included palatability (taste), willingness to repeat bowel preparation, gastrointestinal adverse events and the quality of bowel preparation. Data across studies were pooled using a random-effects model and heterogeneity assessed using I2-statistics. Results: Of 467 studies screened, six were included for analysis (all single-blind randomised trials; n = 1187 patients). Adjuncts comprised citrus reticulata peel, orange juice, menthol candy drops, simethicone, Coke Zero and sugar-free chewing gum. Overall, adjunct use was associated with improved palatability (mean difference 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.29–0.96, p < 0.001) on a scale of 0–5, acceptability of taste (odds ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.52–4.95, p < 0.001) and willingness to repeat bowel preparation (odds ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval: 1.97–4.35, p < 0.001). Patients in the adjunct group reported lower rates of bloating (odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.29–0.77, p = 0.003) and vomiting (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.81, p = 0.007), but no difference in nausea (p = 0.10) or abdominal pain (p = 0.62). Adjunct use resulted in superior bowel cleanliness (odds ratio 2.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.31–4.85, p = 0.006). Heterogeneity varied across outcomes, ranging from 0% (vomiting) to 81% (palatability), without evidence of publication bias. The overall quality of evidence was rated moderate. Conclusion: In this meta-analysis, the use of adjuncts was associated with better palatability, less vomiting and bloating, willingness to repeat bowel preparation and superior quality of bowel preparation. The addition of adjuncts to bowel preparation may improve outcomes of colonoscopy and the overall patient experience. © Author(s) 2020.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kamran U; Abbasi A; Tahir I; Hodson J; Siau K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kamran U, Abbasi A, Tahir I, Hodson J, and Siau K (2020) Can adjuncts to bowel preparation for colonoscopy improve patient experience and result in superior bowel cleanliness?

A total of 160 primipara pregnant women delivered by caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomised into four groups: group 1 (those who received acupressure), group 2 (coffee was provided three times a day), group 3 (chewed sugar-free gum for 15 min with an interval of 4 h from the second postoperative hour), and group 4 (control group). The first gas outflow and defaecation times of the women were compared among the groups. The first flatus and defaecation exit times of the women in the acupressure group were statistically earlier than those of the other groups. No difference was found among the gum-chewing, coffee, and control groups. Acupressure is effective in reducing the flatus and defaecation exit times due to GIS inactivity after abdominal surgery including caesarean section.Impact statementWhat is already known about the topic. The slowing of gastrointestinal system (GIS) motility also occurs after caesarean section aside from other surgical operations. If normal GIS movements do not occur, then several problems, such as the negative increase in the duration of breastfeeding and the mother–baby attachment during the postpartum period, may arise. Therefore, the early onset of bowel functions is important in women who give birth by caesarean section. What do the results of this study add. In the postoperative period, spontaneous GIS motility can be achieved by applying acupressure. The effective use of acupressure in the postoperative period prevents the need for pharmacological methods to eliminate the discomfort caused by the decreased motility of the GIS in women in the postpartum period. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and further research. Acupressure, a non-invasive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective method, plays a role in preventing GIS immotility. Midwives or obstetricians should receive training on acupuncture or acupressure and should ensure that acupuncture or acupressure practices are converted into a protocol to be implemented in the postoperative period. With this transformation, the treatment methods to increase GIS motility and the reduced medication use can decrease the mother’s and the newborn’s duration of hospital stay and the cost of hospitalisation.","Comments":"2020-08-24","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kanza Gül; D; Şolt Kırca; A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/01443615.2020.1787363","Keywords":"acupressure\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee consumption\r\ncontrolled study\r\nconvalescence\r\ndefecation\r\nexperimental study\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\ngastrointestinal motility\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmastication\r\npostoperative care\r\npregnant woman\r\nprimipara\r\nspinal anesthesia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kanza Gül, D, Şolt Kırca, and A (2021) Effects of acupressure, gum chewing and coffee consumption on the gastrointestinal system after caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia.

Acquired - or established- vagal dysfunction may contribute to PGID, even for surgery not involving the gastrointestinal tract. However, direct evidence for this is lacking. We hypothesized that chewing gum reduces morbidity (including PGID) by preserving efferent vagal neural activity postoperatively after elective orthopaedic surgery. Methods In a two-centre randomized controlled trial (n=106), we explored whether patients randomized to prescribed chewing gum for five days postoperatively sustained less morbidity (primary outcome, defined by the Postoperative Morbidity Survey), PGID and faster time to become morbidity free (secondary outcomes). In a subset of patients (n=38), cardiac parasympathetic activity was measured by serial Holter monitoring and assessed using time and frequency domain analyses. Results Between September 2011 and April 2014, 106 patients were randomized to chewing gum or control. The primary clinical outcome did not differ between groups, with similar morbidity occurring between patients randomized to control (26/30) and chewing gum (21/28; absolute risk reduction (ARR):13% (95%C I:- 6-32); P=0.26). However, chewing gum reduced PGID (ARR:20% (95% CI: 1-38); P=0.049). Chewing gum reduced time to become morbidity-free (relative risk (RR): 1.62 (95% CI: 1.02-2.58); P=0.04) and was associated with a higher proportion of parasympathetic activity contributing to heart rate variability (11% (95% CI: 1-20); P=0.03). Conclusions Chewing gum did not alter overall morbidity, but reduced PGID. These data show for the first time that prescription of sham feeding preserves vagal activity in surgery not directly involving the gastrointestinal tract. © The Author 2015.

Twelve volleyball players participated ina randomized, crossover, and double-blind experiment after ingestion of (a) ~3.2 ± 0.4 mg/kg of body mass (BM) of caffeine via chewing gum or (b) non-caffeinated chewing gum (placebo) and performed: (a) a countermovement jump, (b) a squat jump, (c), an attack jump, (d) a block jump, (e) 5 and 10 m sprints, (f) a modified agility t-test, (g) an attack and service speed test, and (h) a spike and serve accuracy test. Compared to the placebo, the caffeine chewing gum supplementation significantly improved the accuracy of the attack (15 ± 4 vs. 18 ± 3 points, p = 0.02). However, the ingestion of caffeinated chewing gum had no effect on the remaining other performance tests (p from 0.12 to 1.00). A caffeine-containing chewing gum with a dose of ~3 mg/kg BM effectively improved the attack’s accuracy in volleyball players. However, this effect was not observed in better results in jumping, running, and other skill-based volleyball tests.","Comments":"2023-02-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kaszuba M; Klocek O; Spieszny M; Filip-Stachnik A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu15010091","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nplacebo\r\naccuracy\r\nadult\r\nagility\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nathlete\r\nathletic performance\r\nbody mass\r\ncaffeine intake\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nfemale\r\ngastrointestinal symptom\r\nheadache\r\nheart palpitation\r\nhuman\r\nhydration\r\ningestion\r\njumping\r\nmale\r\nnervousness\r\nnormal human\r\nphysical performance\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrunning\r\nside effect\r\nsport nutrition\r\nsupplementation\r\ntachycardia\r\nurine volume\r\nvelocity\r\nvolleyball","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kaszuba M, Klocek O, Spieszny M, and Filip-Stachnik A (2023) The Effect of Caffeinated Chewing Gum on Volleyball-Specific Skills and Physical Performance in Volleyball Players.

Its unpleasant symptoms may limit the acceptance of VR technologies for training or clinical purposes. Mechanical stimulation of the mastoid and diverting attention to pleasant stimuli-like odors or music have been found to ameliorate VIMS. Chewing gum combines both in an easy-to-administer fashion and should thus be an effective countermeasure against VIMS. Our study investigated whether gustatory-motor stimulation by chewing gum leads to a reduction of VIMS symptoms. 77 subjects were assigned to three experimental groups (control, peppermint gum, and ginger gum) and completed a 15-min virtual helicopter flight, using a VR head-mounted display. Before and after VR exposure, we assessed VIMS with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), and during the virtual flight once every minute with the Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS). Chewing gum (peppermint gum: M = 2.44, SD = 2.67; ginger gum: M = 2.57, SD = 3.30) reduced the peak FMS scores by 2.05 (SE = 0.76) points as compared with the control group (M = 4.56, SD = 3.52), p < 0.01, d = 0.65. Additionally, taste ratings correlated slightly negatively with both the SSQ and the peak FMS scores, suggesting that pleasant taste of the chewing gum is associated with less VIMS. Thus, chewing gum may be useful as an affordable, accepted, and easy-to-access way to mitigate VIMS in numerous applications like education or training. Possible mechanisms behind the effect are discussed.","Comments":"2022-04-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kaufeld M; De Coninck K; Schmidt J; Hecht H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00221-021-06303-5","Keywords":"virtual reality head mounted display\r\npeppermint\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease assessment\r\neducation\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmotion sickness\r\nquestionnaire\r\nSimulator Sickness Questionnaire","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kaufeld M, De Coninck K, Schmidt J, and Hecht H (2022) Chewing gum reduces visually induced motion sickness.

We focused on the health benefits of gum chewing, as no studies have been carried out on the impact of gum-chewing routines on the health of older adults. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether the gum-chewing routine is associated with oral, physical and cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: This study included 1617 community-dwelling older participants in a health survey carried out in 2021. The gum-chewing routine and weekly chewing time were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The outcome measures, including actual measurements of oral function, physical function, cognitive function, dietary intake and lifestyle, were evaluated using self-administered questionnaires or health surveys. Results: We analyzed 1474 (mean age 76.1 ± 5.8 years, 45% women) participants for whom all data were not missing, and 14% of them had a gum-chewing routine for more than 30 min weekly. Oral functions were significantly higher in older adults with a gum-chewing routine, and there were substantially fewer participants with oral frailty (adjusted odds ratio 0.581, 95% confidence interval 0.340–0.993). Additionally, cognitive and physical functions, including grip strength, were significantly higher in the gum-chewing routine group. Conclusions: Community-dwelling older adults with a gum-chewing routine have higher oral, physical and cognitive functions. These findings indicate that a gum-chewing routine might contribute to maintaining oral function and preventing frailty. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; 24: 68–74. © 2023 The Authors.

In addition to the challenge of choosing appropriate analgesia, there is often low parent and child adherence. This article presents a review, and evaluates the potential role, of a range of complementary and alternative therapies that may be sought out by parents. Methods: A literature review of complementary and alternative interventions performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE, supplemented by searches from Google and hand searches of cross-references of selected articles, yielded 32 studies for qualitative analysis. Results: The studies included for analysis investigated a wide variety of alternative treatment modalities: acupuncture and related therapies, aromatherapy, homeopathy, honey, intravenous fluid, speech therapy, hyaluronic acid, behavioral therapies, ice/cold, hydrogen peroxide rinse, and chewing gum. Conclusion: At this time, stronger conclusions cannot be made about the therapies investigated because there are many methodology limitations of the studies analyzed. However, our results suggest merit for these treatments as adjuvant therapies that can enhance analgesia and decrease requirements of controversial medications. Honey and acupuncture have the greatest amount of evidence for postoperative pain and nausea; however, all interventions examined were cost-effective and safe.

Human populations have shown a close association between masticatory function, cognitive status and age-related neurodegeneration in the elderly. Evidence shows that mastication during tasks may have an acute positive impact on normal cognitive function, such as sustained attention. However, there is a lack of evidence showing the long-Term effects of changes in habitual masticatory behaviour on cognition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a 3-month mastication intervention on cognitive function in healthy older adults. METHODS: 53 participants aged 45-70 years old were required to chew mint-flavoured sugar free chewing gum for 10 minutes, 3 times a day over 3 months. Pattern separation and recognition memory was measured using the Mnemonic Similarity Task. Questionnaires were administered to measure changes in mood, anxiety, and sleep quality. RESULTS: Extended periods of mastication gave rise to a significant improvement in recognition memory compared to a non-chewing control group. CONCLUSION:With an ageing population, non-medical interventions are imperative to delay age-related cognitive decline. Further work needs to be carried out in larger populations to validate the findings in this study and elucidate potential mechanisms. © 2019 IOS Press.

This cross-sectional study examined prevalence of caffeine consumers, daily caffeine consumption, and factors associated with caffeine use among United States active duty military service members (SMs). Methods: A stratified random sample of SMs were asked to complete an on-line questionnaire on their personal characteristics and consumption of caffeinated products (exclusive of dietary supplements). Eighteen percent (n = 26,680) of successfully contacted SMs (n = 146,365) completed the questionnaire. Results: Overall, 87% reported consuming caffeinated products ≥1 time/week. Mean ± standard error per-capita consumption (all participants) was 218 ± 2 and 167 ± 3 mg/day for men and women, respectively. Caffeine consumers ingested 243 ± 2 mg/day (251 ± 2 mg/day men, 195 ± 3 mg/day women). On a body-weight basis, men and women consumed respectively similar caffeine amounts (2.93 vs 2.85 mg/day/kg; p = 0.12). Among individual caffeinated products, coffee had the highest use (68%), followed by sodas (42%), teas (29%), energy drinks (29%) and gums/candy/medications (4%). In multivariable logistic regression, characteristics independently associated with caffeine use (≥1 time/week) included female gender, older age, white race/ethnicity, higher body mass index, tobacco use or former use, greater alcohol intake, and higher enlisted or officer rank. Conclusion: Compared to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, daily caffeine consumption (mg/day) by SMs was higher, perhaps reflecting higher mental and physical occupational demands on SMs.","Comments":"2022-05-10","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Knapik J J; Steelman R A; Trone D W; Farina E K; Lieberman H R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12937-022-00774-0","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nsodium carbonate\r\nadult\r\nalcohol consumption\r\narticle\r\nbody mass\r\nbody weight\r\ncaffeine intake\r\ncandy\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee\r\ncohort analysis\r\nconsumer\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncross-sectional study\r\ndrug use\r\nenergy drink\r\nenlisted rank\r\nethnic difference\r\nfemale\r\ngroups by age\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmilitary personnel\r\noccupation and occupation related phenomena\r\nofficer rank\r\nprevalence\r\nrace difference\r\nsex difference\r\nsleep\r\ntea\r\ntobacco use\r\nUnited States\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Knapik J J, Steelman R A, Trone D W, Farina E K, and Lieberman H R (2022) Prevalence of caffeine consumers, daily caffeine consumption, and factors associated with caffeine use among active duty United States military personnel.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested the efficacy of gum chewing for the prevention of postoperative ileus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of gum chewing for the recovery of bowel function after surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer and to determine the physiological mechanism underlying the effect of gum chewing on bowel function. DESIGN: This was a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, prospective randomized trial. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a general hospital in Japan. PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients with left-sided colorectal cancer were included. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomly assigned to a gum group (N = 25) and a control group (N = 23). Four patients in the gum group and 1 in the control group were subsequently excluded because of difficulties in continuing the trial, resulting in the analysis of 21 and 22 patients in the respective groups. Patients in the gum group chewed commercial gum 3 times a day for ≥5 minutes each time from postoperative day 1 to the first day of food intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The time to first flatus and first bowel movement after the operation were recorded, and the colonic transit time was measured. Gut hormones (gastrin, des-acyl ghrelin, motilin, and serotonin) were measured preoperatively, perioperatively, and on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. RESULTS: Gum chewing did not significantly shorten the time to the first flatus (53 ± 2 vs 49 ± 26 hours; p = 0.481; gum vs control group), time to first bowel movement (94 ± 44 vs 109 ± 34 hours; p = 0.234), or the colonic transit time (88 ± 28 vs 88 ± 21 hours; p = 0.968). However, gum chewing significantly increased the serum levels of des-acyl ghrelin and gastrin.

Material and methods: This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized controlled single-blind interventional study. Patients were randomized into two groups: control group which received a standard postoperative protocol and the chewing gum group which received the same postoperative protocol. Pain was evaluated by the Wong Baker scale. Results: A total of 75 patients participated in the study, with 40 in the control group and 35 in the chewing gum group. The children's mean age and gender distribution were similar across the groups. According to the independent t-test results, there was a significant difference in pain levels between the chewing gum and control groups on all days. The pain levels in the chewing gum group were lower compared to the control group. Analgesic use was also lower in the gum group on all days (p < 0.05). Generalized linear mixed model analysis confirmed a significant independent effect of chewing gum on pain scores (p < 0.001), though the effect did not vary over time. Conclusion: In conclusion, chewing gum may serve as a non-pharmacological method for postoperative pain management. In clinical practice, chewing gum could be a simple, low-cost, and easy-to-implement intervention.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Koksoy Vayısoglu; S; Gur H; Oncu E; Ismi O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijporl.2025.112362","Keywords":"paracetamol\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nchild\r\nclinical practice\r\ncontrolled study\r\nFaces Pain Scale\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nintervention study\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\npediatric patient\r\npostoperative pain\r\npreschool child\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nschool child\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nStudent t test\r\ntonsillectomy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Koksoy Vayısoglu, S, Gur H, Oncu E, and Ismi O (2025) The effect of chewing gum on postoperative pain in children undergoing tonsillectomy.

Also, studies in animals have demonstrated that active chewing of a wooden stick during immobilization stress ameliorates the stress-impaired synaptic plasticity and prevents stress-induced noradrenaline release in the amygdala. On the other hand, studies have suggested that the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) dominates the regulation of the stress response system, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The International Affective Digitized Sounds-2 (IADS) is widely used in the study of emotions and neuropsychological research. Therefore, in this study, the effects of gum-chewing on physiological and psychological (including PFC activity measured by NIRS) responses to a negative stimulus selected from the IADS were measured and analyzed. The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Dental College (No. 436). We studied 11 normal adults using: cerebral blood oxygenation in the right medial PFC by multi-channel NIRS; alpha wave intensity by EEG; autonomic nervous function by heart rate; and emotional conditions by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Auditory stimuli selected were fewer than 3.00 in Pleasure value. Sounds were recorded in 3 s and reproduced at random using software. Every task session was designed in a block manner; seven rests: Brown Noise (30 s) and six task blocks: auditory stimuli or auditory stimuli with gum-chewing (30 s). During the test, the participants' eyes were closed. Paired Student's t-test was used for the comparison (P<0.05). Gum-chewing showed a significantly greater activation in the PFC, alpha wave appearance rate and HR. Gum-chewing also showed a significantly higher VAS score and a smaller STAI level indicating 'pleasant'. Gum-chewing affected physiological and psychological responses including PFC activity. This PFC activation change might influence the HPA axis and ANS activities. In summary, within the limitations of this study, the findings suggest that gum-chewing reduced stress-related responses. Gum-chewing might have a possible effect on stress coping.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Konno M; Takeda T; Kawakami Y; Suzuki Y; Kawano Y; Nakajima K; Ozawa T; Ishigami K; Takemura N; Sakatani K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4939-3023-4_43 ","Keywords":"Adaptation, Psychological\r\nAdult\r\n*Chewing Gum\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology\r\nMale\r\nPituitary-Adrenal System/physiology\r\nPrefrontal Cortex/physiology\r\n*Stress, Psychological\r\nVisual Analog Scale\r\nElectroencephalogram\r\nGum-chewing\r\nInternational Affective Digitized Sounds-2\r\nNear-infrared spectroscopy\r\nPrefrontal cortex","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Konno M, Takeda T, Kawakami Y, Suzuki Y, Kawano Y, Nakajima K, Ozawa T, Ishigami K, Takemura N, and Sakatani K (2016) Relationships Between Gum-Chewing and Stress..

We tested the hypothesis that gum chewing would increase energy expenditure (EE) and reduce respiratory exchange ratio (RER) before and after a controlled test meal. Seventeen males and 13 females (age 21.5 ± 6.6 years, body mass index 23.9 ± 2.8 kg/m(2)) participated in a randomized crossover study in which subjects chewed sugar-free gum for a total of 1 h (3 sessions of 20 min) on the test day (GC) and did not chew gum on a control day (NG). EE and RER were measured by indirect calorimetry after an overnight fast. Subjects consumed a breakfast shake containing 30% of their measured energy needs, and then postprandial EE and RER were measured for 3 h. Blood glucose (GLC) was measured in the fasting and postprandial states at regular intervals. Fasting EE was higher during GC (1.23 ± 0.04 kcal/min; 1 kcal = 4.2 kJ) than during NG (1.17 ± 0.04 kcal/min; p = 0.016). Postprandial EE was also higher during GC (1.46 ± 0.05 kcal/min) than during NG (1.42 ± 0.05 kcal/min; p = 0.037). Fasting and postprandial RER and GLC did not differ between GC and NG. The findings demonstrate that GC is associated with higher fasting and postprandial EE without altering blood glucose or substrate oxidation as measured by RER. These data suggest that gum chewing potentially could influence short-term energy balance in this population; however, longer-term research is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kresge DL; Melanson K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1139/apnm-2014-0232 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nBlood Glucose/metabolism\r\nBody Mass Index\r\n*Breakfast\r\nCalorimetry, Indirect\r\n*Chewing Gum\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\n*Energy Metabolism\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPostprandial Period\r\nRespiratory System/metabolism\r\nSatiation\r\nYoung Adult\r\ncalorimétrie indirecte\r\nenergy balance\r\nindirect calorimetry\r\nmastication\r\nmétabolisme de repos\r\noxydation des substrats\r\npostprandial\r\nratio d’échanges gazeux\r\nrespiratory exchange ratio\r\nresting metabolic rate\r\nsubstrate oxidation\r\nthermic effect of food\r\nthermogenèse alimentaire\r\néquilibre énergétique","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kresge DL, and Melanson K (2015) Chewing gum increases energy expenditure before and after controlled breakfasts..

Methods: The study was conducted in Department of General Surgery, Narayan Medical College and Hospital, Sasaram, Bihar, India for the period of one year. Total 100 patients were enrolled, 50 were cases gum chewing and 50 were controls. This was an interventional (Experimental) prospective study. The intervention was very simple, it was allowing the cases to chew chewing gums after surgery. Results: Mean duration of hospitalization (days) was 12.8, 12.48 in cases and control groups respectively. Flatus (mean duration of first flatus passed) in hours was 50.9, 67.3 in cases and control groups respectively. Motion (mean duration of first bowel passed) in hours was 93.7, 128.2 in cases and control groups respectively. Bowel sound (mean duration first sound heard) in hours was 21.5, 35.3 in cases of routine surgery, emergency surgeries respectively.

AIM: This study was conducted to assess chewing gum’s role in post-operative bowel recovery after gynecological laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: This prospective clinical trial recruited 60 participants who had undergone gynecological laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The study was conducted at Arifin Achmad Hospital, Riau Province, Indonesia, from January to April 2021. The patients were equally divided into two groups: Intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30). They were asked to chew sugar-free gum every 2 h after the surgery (i.e. 5 times within 10 h post-surgery). Time of the first flatus and the first bowel sounds were recorded (i.e. 5 times of assessment within 10 h post-surgery). In addition, a literature review was conducted to add evidence of the role of chewing gum on postoperative bowel recovery after gynecological laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS: Patients from both groups had a close age range (23–44-year-old versus 21–42-year-old). Our data suggested a significant difference in the time of the first flatus between the treatment and control group (15.95 h vs. 45.05 h), p < 0.001. The length of stay in the hospital among those from the treatment group was also significantly shorter compared to controls (15.50 h vs. 45.50 h), p < 0.001. The literature review of four updated randomized clinical trials suggests chewing gum in the early onset of first flatus and bowel movement. CONCLUSION: Chewing gum following gynecological laparoscopic surgery could accelerate gastrointestinal recovery.","Comments":"2021-11-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kusika N P; Hutagaol I E.B; Yusuf M; Suyanto S; Tilusari S P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3889/oamjms.2021.7133","Keywords":"article\r\nbody mass\r\nbody weight loss\r\nchewing gum\r\ngeneral anesthesia\r\nglycemic index\r\ngynecology\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\ninformation processing\r\ninformation retrieval\r\ninformed consent\r\ninterview\r\nintestine\r\nintestine sound\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nlaparotomy\r\nlength of stay\r\nmedical record\r\noperation duration\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kusika N P, Hutagaol I E.B, Yusuf M, Suyanto S, and Tilusari S P (2021) The role of chewing gum on post-operative bowel recovery after gynecological laparoscopic surgery: A short report and updated review.

Gum chewing has been shown to stimulate bowel motility and decrease duration of POI after abdominal surgery. We evaluated the effect of gum chewing in reducing the time to first flatus and on oral calorie intake in patients undergoing living or deceased donor liver transplantation. Patients were randomized into the sham feeding group or the control group. The sham feeding group chewed two pieces of xylitol flavored gum for 15 minutes, three times a day after extubation until oral nutrition was tolerated. The control group received the same routine care except for the gum chewing. Fifty-nine patients were randomized into the sham feeding group (n=30) or the control group (n=29). There was no difference in the time to first flatus (72 [66.1-82.9] hours vs 69.0 [57.6-77.2] hours, P=.422). Cumulative energy intake (2.8 [5.8-23.2] % vs 10.0 [8.5-15.9] %, P=.695) and length of intensive care unit stay (4.2 [3.9-5.3] days vs 4.0 [6.7-4.5] days, P=.077) were also similar. In conclusion, sham feeding with gum chewing did not shorten the duration of POI nor facilitate oral intake after liver transplantation.

Gum chewing, a form of sham feeding, was examined as a possible efficient intervention to reduce the discomfort from consuming polyethylene glycol. Background: Sham feeding is a method that is similar to food intake, which stimulates the cephalic-vagal reflex, promotes secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, and stimulates movement of the gastrointestinal tract. Sham feeding with chewing gum has been shown to promote bowel motility. Design: This was an experimental study utilising a randomised control group post-test design. Methods: This study was conducted in Seoul, Korea from August-October 2012. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups; a gum-chewing group (n = 66) or a control group (n = 65). In the control group, patients drank a polyethylene glycol solution according to the general protocol. For the gum-chewing group, patients had to chew one stick of sugarless gum during the pause interval of drinking the polyethylene glycol solution. Results were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test, t-test, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: The gum-chewing group reported significantly lower abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting and took a shorter time to ingest the polyethylene glycol solution than the control group. Conclusion: Gum chewing is efficient in improving abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting and the intake adherence of patients in colonoscopy preparation. Relevance to clinical practice: Gum chewing was demonstrated by this study to be a potentially effective nursing intervention that is easy for patients to perform with simple instructions and is low cost with no side effects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee J; Lee E; Kim Y; Kim E; Lee Y; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee J, Lee E, Kim Y, Kim E, and Lee Y (2016) Effects of gum chewing on abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting and intake adherence to polyethylene glycol solution of patients in colonoscopy preparation.

Methods: Women who underwent cesarean section (N = 120) were randomly allocated into Group A (xylitol gum), Group B (nonxylitol gum), or the control group (no chewing gum). Every 2 hr post-cesarean section and until first flatus, Groups A and B received two pellets of chewing gum and were asked to chew for 15 min. The times to first bowel sounds, first flatus, and first defecation were then compared among the three groups. Results: Group A had the shortest mean time to first bowel sounds (6.9 ± 1.7 hr), followed by Group B (8 ± 1.6 hr) and the control group (12.8 ± 2.5 hr; one-way analysis of variance, p <.001; Scheffe’s post hoc comparisons, p <.05). The gum-chewing groups demonstrated a faster return of flatus than the control group did (p <.001), but the time to flatus did not differ significantly between the gum-chewing groups. Additionally, the differences in the time to first defecation were not significant. Conclusion: After cesarean section, chewing gum increased participants’ return of bowel activity, as measured by the appearance of bowel sounds and the passage of flatus. In this context, xylitol-containing gum may be superior to xylitol-free gum. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee J T; Hsieh M H; Cheng P J; Lin J R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee J T, Hsieh M H, Cheng P J, and Lin J R (2016) The Role of Xylitol Gum Chewing in Restoring Postoperative Bowel Activity After Cesarean Section.

Studies suggest that abstinence rates are higher with combined NRT than single NRT, although local data on safety and benefits of combined NRT are lacking. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of combined NRT with single NRT among HK Chinese. Methods: This is a one-year, two-arm, parallel randomised trial. Five hundred sixty smokers, who smoked ≥10 cigarettes/day for ≥1 year, were randomized to combined and single NRT. Combined NRT group received counseling and nicotine patch & gum. Single NRT group received counselling and nicotine patch. Primary outcome was abstinence rate measured as self-reported 7-day point prevalence with CO validated at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included smoking abstinence rates at 4, 12, & 26 weeks. Crude odds ratio and p-value were reported from logistic regression without adjustment; for trend analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and p-value were reported from Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) (controlling for time). All AORs were adjusted for age, sex, baseline CO and clusters. Results: Abstinence rates at 4, 12, 26 and 52 weeks were all higher in the combined NRT group (35.8, 21.9, 16.8, 20.1%) compared with the single NRT group (28, 16.8, 11.2, 14.3%). At 4 weeks, combined NRT group was more likely to quit smoking (OR 1.43, 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.05) than the single NRT group. From GEE analysis, combined NRT group had a significantly higher abstinence rate (23.6%) than the single NRT group (17.6%) across repeated measures at all-time points. Combined NRT group was more likely to quit smoking (OR 1.43, 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.77). No significant difference in the side effect profile was detected between groups. Conclusions: Smokers given 8 weeks of combined NRT were more likely to quit smoking at 4, 12, 26 and 52 weeks compared with single NRT. Combined NRT was as well tolerated as single NRT and it should be further promoted in our community.

Chewing gum is proposed as a remedy, yet existing reviews offer conflicting results. This umbrella review aims to synthesize the effectiveness of chewing gum on time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, length of stay and complication rates in adult patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review, searching seven databases up to 17 November 2023, with an updated search extending to 1 January 2025. The focus was on post-surgery chewing gum interventions. The quality and certainty of evidence were assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool and umbrella review criteria. RESULTS: Seventeen reviews, encompassing 26 672 participants from 264 primary studies, were included. Meta-analyses indicated reductions in time to first flatus by -0.36 days (95% CI = -0.61, -0.1) or -12.26 hours (95% CI = -14.73, -9.78), time to first bowel movement by -0.59 days (95% CI = -0.94, -0.23) or -19.29 hours (95% CI = -23.79, -14.79), and length of stay by -0.85 days (95% CI = -1.22, -0.48) or -20.08 hours (95% CI = -28.62, -11.54). Additionally, chewing gum was associated with fewer postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Chewing gum may significantly aid postoperative care by reducing time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, and length of stay. However, many included reviews were of low quality with weak evidence, highlighting the need for more rigorous studies to confirm these benefits. Integrating chewing gum into clinical practice could enhance recovery and optimize hospital bed turnover, making it a valuable addition to postoperative care protocols.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lew S L; Cheng L J; Yap S Y; Liaw Y Q; Park J; Lau S T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JS9.0000000000002332","Keywords":"abdominal surgery\r\nadult\r\nadverse event\r\nchewing gum\r\nconvalescence\r\nhuman\r\nlength of stay\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative complication\r\nprevention and control\r\nprocedures\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lew S L, Cheng L J, Yap S Y, Liaw Y Q, Park J, and Lau S T (2025) Effect of chewing gum on clinical outcomes and postoperative recovery in adult patients after gastrointestinal surgery: an umbrella review.

Thus, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing articles to evaluate the effect of gum-chewing on patients following spinal surgery. Methods: A computer search was used to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving gum-chewing from eight databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and WanFang Data. After evaluating the risk of bias for the included studies, we used the Revman 5.3 software to conduct a meta-analysis of the data. Results: The study included seven RCTs, with a total of 706 patients. The meta-analysis reported that gum-chewing could shorten the interval between surgery and first bowel movement (mean deviation [MD] = − 23.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: − 24.67, − 21.38; P < 0.00001), first flatus (MD = − 1.54; 95% CI − 2.48, − 0.60; P = 0.001), and first bowel sounds (MD = − 5.08; 95% CI − 6.02, − 4.15; P < 0.00001). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in postoperative analgesic dosage within 12 h (standardised mean difference [SMD] = − 0.28; 95% CI − 0.52, − 0.05; P = 0.02). However, there were no significant differences between the chewing gum and control groups (P > 0.05) regarding the postoperative nausea score, abdominal pain score, 24- and 48-h analgesic drug dosage, and length of hospital stay. Conclusion: To a certain extent, masticating gum can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function and reduce the need for postoperative analgesics in patients following spinal surgery. However, this conclusion is affected by the quantity and quality of the included articles. Therefore, additional high-quality studies are needed to verify these results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liao X Q; Li S L; Peng Y C; Chen L W; Lin Y J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liao X Q, Li S L, Peng Y C, Chen L W, and Lin Y J (2022) Effects of chewing gum on gastrointestinal function in patients following spinal surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review.

Methodological quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials. A meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model to calculate pooled effects with Review Manager 5.4.1. FINDINGS: Twelve randomized trials encompassing 1,458 participants were pooled. The chewing gum intervention was effective in reducing vomiting (P = .007; risk ratio = 0.55; 95% Cl = 0.35-0.85), but not nausea (P = .14; risk ratio = 0.84; 95% Cl = 0.66-1.06).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether ECs are superior to NRT and noninferior to varenicline in helping smokers quit. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 7 sites in China and including participants who were smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day and motivated to quit, not using stop-smoking medications or EC, and willing to use any of the study products. Participants were first recruited in May 2021, and data analysis was conducted in December 2022. INTERVENTIONS A cartridge-based EC (30 mg/mL nicotine salt for 2 weeks and 50 mg/mL after that), varenicline (0.5 mg, once a day for 3 days; 0.5 mg, twice a day for 4 days; and 1 mg, twice a day, after that), and 2 mg (for smokers of ≤20 cigarettes per day) or 4 mg (>20 cigarettes per day) nicotine chewing gum, all provided for 12 weeks and accompanied by minimal behavioral support (an invitation to join a self-help internet forum). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was sustained abstinence from smoking at 6 months as validated by an expired-air carbon monoxide reading (<8 parts per million). Participants lost to follow-up were included as nonabstainers. RESULTS Of 1068 participants, 357 (33.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 33.9 (3.1) years. A total of 409 (38.3%), 409 (38.3%), and 250 (23.4%) participants were randomized to the EC, varenicline, and NRT arms, respectively. The 6-month biochemically validated abstinence rates were 15.7% (n = 64), 14.2% (n = 58), and 8.8% (n = 22) in the EC, varenicline, and NRT study arms, respectively. The quit rate in the EC arm was noninferior to the varenicline arm (absolute risk reduction, 1.47%; 95% CI, −1.41% to 4.34%) and higher than in the NRT arm (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.21). Treatment adherence was similar in all study arms during the initial 3 months, but 257 participants (62.8%) in the EC arm were still using ECs at 6 months, with no further use in the 2 other study arms. The most common adverse reactions were throat irritation (32 [7.8%]) and mouth irritation (28 [6.9%]) in the EC arm, nausea (36 [8.8%]) in the varenicline arm, and throat irritation (20 [8.0%]) and mouth irritation (22 [8.8%]) in the NRT arm. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this randomized clinical trial found that when all treatments were provided with minimal behavior support, the efficacy of EC was noninferior to varenicline and superior to nicotine chewing gum.","Comments":"2024-03-18","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lin H X; Liu Z; Hajek P; Zhang W T; Wu Y; Zhu B C; Liu H H; Xiang Q; Zhang Y; Li S B; Pesola F; Wang Y Y; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.7846","Keywords":"ChiCTR2100048156\r\nelectronic cigarette\r\ncarbon monoxide\r\nnicotine gum\r\nvarenicline\r\nadult\r\nadverse event\r\narticle\r\nbiochemical analysis\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\nclinical evaluation\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndry cough\r\nexpired air\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nheadache\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmouth ulcer\r\nnausea\r\nnicotine replacement therapy\r\npatient compliance\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrisk reduction\r\nscreening test\r\nsleep disorder\r\nsmoking cessation\r\nthroat irritation\r\nchantix","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lin H X, Liu Z, Hajek P, Zhang W T, Wu Y, Zhu B C, Liu H H, Xiang Q, Zhang Y, Li S B, Pesola F, and Wang Y Y (2024) Efficacy of Electronic Cigarettes vs Varenicline and Nicotine Chewing Gum as an Aid to Stop Smoking A Randomized Clinical Trial.

It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018. Selection criteria Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Main results We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I2 = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I2 = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I2 = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I2 = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I2 = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I2 = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low-and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant-versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low-or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low-or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I2 = 0%; low certainty). Authors’ conclusions There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported. © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, conclusions remained contradictory. We sought to conduct an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of gum chewing in alleviating ileus following colorectal surgery. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Databases through February 2017 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of the additional use of chewing gum following colorectal surgery. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment, meta-analysis was conducted by the Review Manager 5.3 software. The outcomes of interest were the time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, length of hospital stay, and some clinically relevant parameters. We also performed subgroup analyses according to the type of surgical approaches or on trials that adopted enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol or sugared gum. Results A total of 18 RCTs, involving 1736 patients, were included. Compared with standardized postoperative care, Chewing gum resulted in a shorter passage to first flatus [WMD = −8.81, 95%CI: (−13.45, −4.17), P = 0.0002], earlier recovery of bowel movement [WMD = −16.43, 95%CI: (−22.68, −10.19), P < 0.00001], and a reduction in length of hospital stay [WMD = −0.89, 95%CI: (−1.72, −0.07), P = 0.03]. Chewing gum was also associated with a lower risk of postoperative ileus [OR = 0.41, 95%CI: (0.23, 0.73), P = 0.003]. No evidence of significant advantages in overall postoperative complication, nausea, vomiting, bloating, readmission and reoperation towards the addition of chewing gum was observed. Subgroup analyses all favored gum chewing. However, the findings are hampered by the significant heterogeneity between trials. Conclusions Based on current evidence, chewing gum offers an inexpensive, well-tolerated, safe and effective method to ameliorate ileus following colorectal surgery. However, tightly controlled, randomized and considerably larger multicenter trials are warranted to further validate our findings. © 2017","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Liu Q; Jiang H; Xu D; Jin J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Liu Q, Jiang H, Xu D, and Jin J (2017) Effect of gum chewing on ameliorating ileus following colorectal surgery: A meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials.

We aim to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of chewing gum to reduce ileus, and decrease time to oral tolerance. Methods A randomized trial was conducted in 5–18 year old patients that underwent an appendectomy. Subjects in the intervention group received sugar-free chewing gum within the first 12 h after surgery and control group received the usual therapy. We assessed the acceptability of the intervention, time to pass first flatus, present first bowel movement, and time to tolerate oral intake. Results A total of 41 patients were recruited, 21 in the intervention group and 20 in the control group. Mean time (SD) to first flatus in the intervention group was 17.18 h (8.18), and 24.37 h (17.53) in the control group (mean difference [MD] of −7.19 h; 95% CI, −15.7 to 1.38).

METHODS: Thirty-six recreational runners (M = 31, F = 5; age 33.7 ± 10.7 y; BMI 23.1 ± 2.4 kg/m(2)) capable of running 5 km in < 25 min were recruited to a study at the Sheffield Hallam parkrun, UK. Runners were block randomized into one of three double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over intervention trials with caffeine gum as the treatment (n = 6 per intervention trial) or into one of three non-intervention trials that ran concurrently with the intervention trials (n = 6 per non-intervention trial). Changes in conditions across different parkruns were adjusted for using data from the non-intervention trials. Runners in the randomized cross-over intervention trials chewed gum supplying 300 mg of caffeine or a placebo gum for 5 min, starting 30 min before each parkrun. RESULTS: Caffeine gum improved 5 km parkrun performance by a mean of 17.28 s (95% CI 4.19, 30.37; P = 0.01). Adjustment for environmental conditions using data from the non-intervention trials attenuated the statistical significance (P = 0.04). Caffeine gum also decreased RPE by 1.21 (95% CI 0.30, 2.13; P = 0·01) units relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: A 300 mg dose of caffeine supplied in chewing gum improved the performance of recreational runners completing 5 km parkruns by an average of 17 s.

Following CD, there is insufficient evidence to support administration of prophylactic multi-dose antibiotics to all patients. Additional antibiotic doses are indicated for the following scenarios: patients with obesity who did not receive preoperative azithromycin, CD lasting ≥4 hours since prophylactic dose, blood loss >1500 mL, or those with an intra-amniotic infection. An oxytocin infusion for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage should be continued post-CD. While initial measures to prevent postoperative pain occur in the intraoperative period, with the consideration of 1 g intravenous (IV) acetaminophen and IV or intramuscular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (eg, 30 mg IV ketorolac), the focus postoperatively continues with this multimodal approach with scheduled acetaminophen per os (PO, 650 mg every 6 hours) and nonsteroidal agents (ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 doses followed by ibuprofen 600 mg PO every 6 hours) being recommended. Short-acting opioids should be reserved for breakthrough pain. Low-risk patients should receive mechanical thromboprophylaxis until ambulation with chemoprophylaxis being reserved for patients with additional risk factors. When an indwelling bladder catheter was placed intraoperatively for scheduled CD, it should be removed immediately postoperatively. Chewing gum to aid in return of bowel function and early oral intake of solid food can occur immediately after CD and within 2 hours, respectively. For prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, administration of 5HT3 antagonists with the addition of either a dopamine antagonist or a corticosteroid is recommended based on noncesarean data. Early ambulation after CD starting 4 hours postoperatively is encouraged and should be incentivized by pedometer. For patients that receive a dressing over the CD skin incision, limited evidence supports leaving it in place for 48 hours. Adjunct nonpharmacologic interventions for postoperative recovery discussed in this review are acupressure, acupuncture, aromatherapy, coffee, ginger, massage, reiki, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. In the low-risk patient, hospital discharge may occur as early as 24 to 28 hours if close (ie, 1–2 days) outpatient neonatal follow-up is available due to the potential for neonatal jaundice; otherwise, patients should be discharged at 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. Upon discharge, the multimodal pain control recommendations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen should be continued. If short-acting opioids are necessary, the prescribing practices should be individualized based upon the inpatient opioid requirements. Other portions of postoperative/postpartum counseling during the inpatient stay include the optimal interpregnancy interval of 18 to 23 months, encouraging exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months, quick resumption of physical activity, and vaginal intercourse guidance as tolerated. Patients should also be counseled pre-CD on the option of immediate postpartum intrauterine devices insertion, intraoperative salpingectomy, or placement of long-acting reversible contraception in the postpartum period. Implementation of such evidence-based postoperative care protocols decrease length of stay, surgical site infection rates, and improve patient satisfaction and breastfeeding rates.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mackeen A D; Sullivan M V; Bender W; Di Mascio D; Berghella V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajogmf.2024.101549","Keywords":"antibiotic agent\r\nazithromycin\r\ncorticosteroid\r\ndopamine\r\ndopamine receptor blocking agent\r\nibuprofen\r\nketorolac\r\nopiate\r\noxytocin\r\nacupuncture\r\namnionitis\r\naromatherapy\r\nbleeding\r\nbreakthrough pain\r\nbreast feeding\r\ncesarean section\r\nchemoprophylaxis\r\nchewing gum\r\nchorioamnionitis\r\ncoitus\r\ncomplication\r\ncontraception\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug administration\r\ndrug therapy\r\nenhanced recovery after surgery\r\nevidence based practice\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nginger\r\nhospital discharge\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nintraoperative period\r\nintrauterine contraceptive device\r\nintravenous drug administration\r\nlength of stay\r\nlong-acting reversible contraception\r\nlow risk patient\r\nmassage\r\nmobilization\r\nnewborn jaundice\r\nobesity\r\npain\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npedometer\r\nphysical activity\r\npostoperative care\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\npostoperative pain\r\npostpartum hemorrhage\r\nprescribing practice\r\nprevention\r\npuerperium\r\nreview\r\nrisk factor\r\nsalpingectomy\r\nskin incision\r\nsurgical infection\r\ntherapy\r\nthrombosis prevention\r\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\r\nurinary catheter\r\nwound healing","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mackeen A D, Sullivan M V, Bender W, Di Mascio D, and Berghella V (2025) Evidence-based cesarean delivery: postoperative care (part 10).

It is hypothesized that chewing gum reduces postoperative ileus by improving early recovery of gastrointestinal function. This study aimed to explore whether chewing gum after appendectomy accelerates the recovery of gastrointestinal function. Methods: Randomized control trial was used in this study. This study was conducted in the General Surgery Department at Zagazig University Hospital. A total of 240 patients undergoing appendectomy were involved in this study; they were divided into the chewing sugar-free gum group (120) and the control group (120). Two tools were utilized in this study. Tool I: Structured Interviewing Schedule: part 1: assessment of personnel characteristics. Part 2: assessment of anthropometric measurements of the studied subjects as well as pre- and intraoperative indicators of them. Tool II: postoperative assessment sheet: assessed postoperative parameters of the intestinal function, occurrence of postoperative ileus, and related symptoms were assessed among studied participants. Results: There were highly significant statistical differences in the time of resumption of gastrointestinal functions and postoperative ileus symptoms between the two groups (P<0.001), which was significantly shorter in the chewing gum group compared to the control group. Conclusions: The use of chewing gum is a useful and cheap method that can be employed to cut down the time to recover and accelerate normalization of gastrointestinal function.

This study compared the effect of chewing gum and the routine method on ileus after burns. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in Valiasr Hospital in Arak, Markazi Province, in the center of Iran, from December 2021 to February 2023. After the diagnosis of intestinal ileus in 83 patients hospitalized in the burn department by a general surgeon, with the available sampling method, these patients were evaluated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. As a result, 66 patients were selected and divided into groups A (33 patients in the intervention group: routine care + gum chewing) and B (33 patients in the control group: routine care) by random allocation method. For the intervention group, from entering the ward until the beginning of oral feeding, gum (without sugar) was chewed four times a day for 15 min, while control groups received the routine diet of the department. Both groups' condition of the bowel sounds, time of passing gas, and stool were recorded. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16. The chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized. RESULTS: The results showed that the median bowel sound return time, time of the first gas discharge, earliest defecation time, and time to start the diet were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed the effect of chewing gum without sugar in shortening the symptoms of intestinal ileus after burns. However, it was not effective in reducing the hospitalization period of patients. According to these results, it is recommended to add chewing gum to the routine care of people hospitalized due to burns.

Caffeine in moderate doses is recognized as an effective intervention for physical and cognitive decrements associated with sleep loss. Methods: This report is based on data collected by two separate, independently conducted surveys administered in Afghanistan in 2011–2012. It assessed caffeine use and sleep disruption among U.S. Army combat soldiers (J-MHAT 8; n = 518) and among deployed soldiers with different military assignments (USARIEM Deployment Survey; n = 260). Results: Daily caffeine intake assessed in the J-MHAT 8 survey averaged 404 ± 18 mg. In the USARIEM Deployment Survey, intake was 303 ± 29 mg and was significantly higher among combat arms soldiers (483 ± 100 mg) compared to combat service support personnel (235 ± 23 mg). In both surveys, over 55% of total caffeine intake was from energy drinks. Additional sources of caffeine included coffee, tea, sodas, gum, candy, and over-the-counter medications. Higher caffeine intake was not associated with ability to fall asleep at night or wake-up in the morning (J-MHAT 8 survey). Higher caffeine consumption was associated with disrupted sleep from high operational tempo and nighttime duties of combat operations. Discussion: Overall caffeine consumption and energy drink use in Afghanistan was greater than among non-deployed soldiers and civilians. Caffeine was frequently used as a countermeasure during night operations to offset adverse effects of sleep loss on physical and cognitive function, consistent with current Department of the Army recommendations.","Comments":"2019-10-17","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McLellan T M; Riviere L A; Williams K W; McGurk D; Lieberman H R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2018.1443996","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nnon prescription drug\r\nsodium carbonate\r\nadult\r\nAfghanistan\r\narmy\r\narticle\r\ncandy\r\nchewing gum\r\ncoffee\r\ncognition\r\nenergy drink\r\nfemale\r\nfitness\r\nhealth status\r\nhealth survey\r\nhuman\r\nleisure\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmilitary deployment\r\nnight shift\r\nprevalence\r\npriority journal\r\nquestionnaire\r\nsleep debt\r\nsleep deprivation\r\nsleep quality\r\nsoft drink\r\nmilitary personnel\r\nsomnolence\r\nphysiological stress\r\ntea\r\ntobacco use\r\nwakefulness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McLellan T M, Riviere L A, Williams K W, McGurk D, and Lieberman H R (2019) Caffeine and energy drink use by combat arms soldiers in Afghanistan as a countermeasure for sleep loss and high operational demands.

Seventeen males and sixteen females (21.4 ± 6.3y, BMI 23.8 ± 2.7 kg/m2) participated in a randomized crossover study in which subjects chewed sugar-free gum a total of 1 h on the test day (GC), and did not chew gum on a control day (NG). The 1 h of gum chewing included 20 min while fasting, and two 20-min sessions between breakfast and lunch. Subjects rated their appetite and mood on visual analog scales. After completing the fasting measures, subjects consumed a breakfast shake containing 30% of their measured resting energy expenditure. Three hours later they consumed an ad libitum lunch with water. Fasting ratings of hunger were lower in GC than NG (t = 2.66, p = 0.01). Subjects consumed significantly less pasta (41 g, 68 kcals, t = 2.32, p = 0.03) during GC than NG.

Materials and Methods: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients scheduled for posterior spinal fusion surgery at our institution were randomized to either group 1 (chewing gum) or group 2 (control). The primary endpoints were time to flatus, time to bowel movement, length of hospital stay, and time to liquid or solid. The secondary endpoints were postoperative opioid consumption, incidence of complications, pain scores, and nausea scores. In addition, a meta-analysis of available data from the literature was performed identifying 2 studies with quantitative data on the efficacy of gum chewing after scoliosis correction surgery. Results: In total, 125 patients (63 gum; 62 control) were included in our analysis after randomization. There was no significant difference in time to first flatus (P=0.087), time to bowel movement (P=0.307), time to liquid or solid, length of postoperative hospital stay (P=0.954), postoperative complications, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea scores between the 2 groups. The postoperative pain scores on postoperative day 1 were significantly lower (P=0.027). There was a significant decrease in the time to the first flatus for patients having selective thoracic fusion in both groups than those having fusion to lumbar spine. Meta-analysis also indicated there was no significant difference in outcomes of bowel function between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Our institutional data and meta-analysis collaboratively suggested that chewing gum did not hasten the return of bowel function.","Comments":"2018-05-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Meng Y; Lin T; Shao W; Jiang H; Li T; Gao R; Zhou X; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/BSD.0000000000000629","Keywords":"narcotic analgesic agent\r\nadolescent\r\nadolescent idiopathic scoliosis\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine motility\r\nlength of stay\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\noperation duration\r\noperative blood loss\r\nposterior spine fusion\r\npostoperative analgesia\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative nausea\r\npostoperative pain\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsystematic review\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Meng Y, Lin T, Shao W, Jiang H, Li T, Gao R, and Zhou X (2018) A Prospective Single-blind Randomized Controlled Trial of Chewing Gum on Bowel Function Recovery After Posterior Spinal Fusion Surgery for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.

The utilization of non-pharmacological treatments can make the childbirth process pleasurable for the mother. This study aimed to determine the effect of chewing gum on anxiety and labor pain intensity in primiparous women. Methods: This randomized controlled study was conducted in two public health centers (Babol, Iran) from May 2021 to October 2022. The participants comprised 116 primiparous women with a gestational age of 38-42 weeks and a diagnosis of labor pain. The pregnant women were subjected to block randomization and allocated to two groups of 58 patients. The intervention group received chewing gum for 20 minutes in the three stages, including dilatation of 3-4 cm, 5-7 cm, and 8-10 cm. The control group received only standard care. The tools used for data collection included demographic and obstetric characteristics, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The data were analyzed hroughtSPSS, version 22, using the Chi-square test, Repeated Measures ANOVA, paired t test, independent t-test, and ANCOVA. A significance level of less than 0.05 was considered. Results: There was a significant difference in the mean pain scores after the intervention between the two groups in dilatation of 3-4 cm (P=0.003), 5-7 cm (P<0.001), and 8-10 cm (P<0.001); also, the chewing gum group had lower pain intensity. There was a significant difference in the mean state anxiety (P<0.001) and trait anxiety (P<0.001) scores after the intervention between the two groups, and the gum chewing group had lower anxiety. Conclusion: Chewing gum is a practical alternative method for decreasing anxiety and pain intensity during childbirth in primiparous women.Trial Registration Number: IRCT20100510003902N5.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohsenzadeh-Ledari F; Omidvar S; Ghanbarpour A; Behmanesh F; Gholinia Ahangar; H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.30476/ijcbnm.2025.102876.2515","Keywords":"adult\r\nanalgesia\r\nanxiety\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nIran\r\nlabor pain\r\npain measurement\r\nparity\r\npregnancy\r\nprocedures\r\npsychology\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\ntherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohsenzadeh-Ledari F, Omidvar S, Ghanbarpour A, Behmanesh F, Gholinia Ahangar, and H (2025) The Effect of Chewing Gum in Managing Labor Pain Intensity and Anxiety Level in Primiparous Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

There are few randomized controlled trials on the impact of chewing gum on the duration of ileus in patients undergoing emergency surgery, notably those with peritonitis. Compelling evidence from studies on elective procedures demonstrates that chewing gum can lessen the duration of ileus. This trial aimed to examine the effect of chewing gum on the length of the postoperative ileus which develop after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations. Materials and methods: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Group A received routine care with chewing gum, while group B only received routine care. The primary outcome was the length of postoperative ileus, while the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, in-hospital morbidity, and mortality. The continuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank sum (Mann-Whitney U) test while the categorical outcomes were compared using the chi-squared test in SPSS version 26. The protocol was retrospectively registered with the WHO Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (Number: PACTR202206468032528) on the 1st of June 2022. Results: Of the 52 participants included in the analysis, the majority were males (80.8%) with a mean age of 34.23 (SD = 11.52) years. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the study participants between the two groups (P > 0.05 for all). The median duration of postoperative ileus was 21.5 h less in the chewing gum group (28.5 versus 50.0, P = 0.002), while the length of hospital stay was 2.5 days less in the chewing gum group (5.4 versus 7.9, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference noted in the occurrence of complications. Conclusion: Chewing gum that is readily available and reasonably priced may help shorten the duration of post-operative ileus, which has the extra benefit of enabling early discharge.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muhumuza J; Molen S F; Bassara G N; Waziri M A; Kithinji S M; Sonye K M; Leocadie M M; Kagenderezo B P; Tshimanga E T; Faustin T M; Lule H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12876-025-04016-5","Keywords":"PACTR202206468032528\r\ndata analysis software\r\nstatistical package for the social science version 22\r\nadult\r\narea under the curve\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndiagnostic test accuracy study\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\ngastroduodenal perforation\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nin-hospital mortality\r\nlaparotomy\r\nlength of stay\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmorbidity\r\nmulticenter study (topic)\r\nomentoplasty\r\noperation duration\r\nperforation\r\npostoperative ileus\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreceiver operating characteristic\r\nretrospective study\r\nsham feeding\r\nstatistical package for the social science version 22","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muhumuza J, Molen S F, Bassara G N, Waziri M A, Kithinji S M, Sonye K M, Leocadie M M, Kagenderezo B P, Tshimanga E T, Faustin T M, and Lule H (2025) The effect of chewing gum on postoperative ileus after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations: a randomized controlled trial.

Nausea, vomiting, and postoperative ileus (POI) frequently occur in patients undergoing cesarean delivery with regional anesthesia. These issues affect patient comfort, slow down wound healing, and prolong hospital stays. Studies have employed various strategies to address these challenges. Chewing gum post-surgery is a cost-effective approach to stimulate intestinal movement, promoting early initiation of oral intake, early mobilization, shorter hospital stays, and reduced overall hospitalization time. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential benefits of chewing gum in this patient population. Methodology We randomly assigned a total of 314 women scheduled for elective or emergency lower segment CS (LSCS) to either a gum-chewing group (Group A, n=157) or a control group receiving standard postoperative care (Group B, n=157). Participants in the gum-chewing group chewed sugar-free gum for one hour postoperatively in sessions lasting 15 minutes each, continuing until bowel sounds resumed, and were allowed to have oral sips of water. In contrast, the control group's bowel sounds were checked every half hour till they appeared, and women were allowed to have sips of water once the bowel sounds were heard. The primary comparisons between the groups focused on the timing of first bowel sounds, first passage of flatus, and first bowel movement. Secondary endpoints included time to mobilization, removal of the catheter, and subjective sense of well-being. Results The average age of women in both groups was 24 years. There were no statistically significant differences between the study and control groups concerning age, parity, occupation, type of CS, reasons for CS, skin incision, or intraperitoneal adhesions. In Group A, the mean time for bowel sounds to appear was 3.39 hours, compared to 6.91 hours in Group B. For flatus passage, the mean time was 12.74 hours in Group A and 20.51 hours in Group B. Stool passage took an average of 41.59 hours in Group A and 64.03 hours in Group B. Conclusions Chewing gum, a type of simulated eating, is linked to faster restoration of gastrointestinal function following CS. This study elucidates the mechanisms behind the benefits of chewing gum and explores its potential in diverse surgical populations. Ultimately, integrating chewing gum into postoperative care may offer a valuable tool for enhancing patient outcomes and accelerating recovery, provided it is used in conjunction with comprehensive and personalized postoperative care strategies. It is a cost-effective approach that accelerates the recovery of intestinal movement post-surgery, decreasing the length of hospital stay and overall burden on patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"N B; Biradar A; Patil N; Yaliwal RG; Biradar P; Gupta N; Kulkarni SS; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.68210 ","Keywords":"caesarean section\r\nearly gut motility\r\ngum chewing\r\npost operative care\r\nsham feeding","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"N B, Biradar A, Patil N, Yaliwal RG, Biradar P, Gupta N, and Kulkarni SS (2024) Chewing Gum Versus Standard Care for Enhanced Bowel Recovery After Cesarean Section: A Randomized Clinical Trial..

One of the leading causes of the increase in the duration of hospitalization of such patients is the surgeons' projections about the development of ileus and defecation. Given the previous studies, misoprostol can increase bowel movements. Moreover, gum-chewing has been recommended as a cheap and available technique for accelerating the resumption of normal Intestinal Movements. Methods and materials: the present study is a single-blind randomized clinical trial which has been done on 324 women over 18 years of age with singleton pregnancy who had visited Taleghani Hospital in Arak and was elective cesarean section candidates. The surgery and anesthesia techniques were similar for all patients. These patients were randomized into three groups of 108, namely control, misoprostol, and gum-chewing groups. The patients in these three groups were compared with one another in terms of normal bowel sound, gas passage, defecation and discharge. Results: the results have shown the mean age of a total of 324 patients has been 26.66 years. The results suggest that the time of hearing the first normal bowel sound, the first gas passage, and defecation have been shorter in the misoprostol group, gum-chewing group and control group, respectively. The difference observed between the three groups has been significant at a 0.05 significance level. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the patients in the misoprostol and gum-chewing groups and the patients in the control group while reviewing the time of discharge of these patients. Conclusion: the findings have been indicative of the positive effects of the misoprostol and gum-chewing techniques on the intestinal function of patients and mothers' breastfeeding. Also, it has been observed that using misoprostol can be more effective than chewing gum.","Comments":"2018-10-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Najdi N; Kamali A; Eslami P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4081/gi.2018.7608","Keywords":"misoprostol\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\nanesthesiological procedure\r\narticle\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ncomparative study\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\ndiarrhea\r\ndrug effect\r\nfemale\r\nfever\r\nhuman\r\nintestine motility\r\nintestine sound\r\nIran\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nnausea\r\npregnancy\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Najdi N, Kamali A, and Eslami P (2018) Comparison of the effect of misoprostol and chewing gum on intestinal movements after cesarean delivery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients who underwent comprehensive surgical staging for gynecological cancer at Rajavithi Hospital between October 1st, 2018 and June 30th, 2019 were randomly allocated into two groups: Gum-chewing group (n=40) and control group (n=42). In the gum-chewing group, patients were assigned to chew sugar-free gum for 30 minutes starting from the first postoperative morning then every 8 hours until the first passage of flatus. In the control group, patients have received routine postoperative care. The primary endpoint was time to first flatus after surgery. The secondary endpoints were time to first bowel sound, time to first defecation, time to first walk, postoperative analgesia and anti-emetic drug requirement, ileus symptoms, length of a hospital stay, and potential adverse events of gum-chewing, including dry mount, choking, and aspiration. RESULT: Chewing gum was statistically significant in reducing time to first flatus compared with routine postoperative care (median 24.7 (range 2.2-86.5) vs 35.4 (range 7.2-80.9) hours, p=0.025). The length of a hospital stay was also significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group (median 3.0 (range 1.0-8.8) vs 3.5 (range 1.8-50.0) days, p=0.023). There were no significant differences in time to first bowel sound, time to first defecation, time to first walk, postoperative analgesia and anti-emetic drug requirement, and ileus symptoms between both two groups. No adverse events related to postoperative gum-chewing were observed. CONCLUSION: Gum-chewing was associated with early recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing surgery for gynecological cancer. It is an inexpensive and physiologic intervention that appears to be reasonably safe and should be recommended as an adjunct in postoperative care of gynecological cancer surgery.","Comments":"2020-04-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nanthiphatthanachai A; Insin P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.761","Keywords":"adult\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nconvalescence\r\nfemale\r\ngynecologic surgery\r\nhospital\r\nhuman\r\nmiddle aged\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nurogenital tract tumor\r\nuterus cancer","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nanthiphatthanachai A, and Insin P (2020) Effect of Chewing Gum on Gastrointestinal Function Recovery After Surgery of Gynecological Cancer Patients at Rajavithi Hospital: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

For V˙O2 kinetics, there were significant effects of bouts on the amplitude, slow component, end V˙O2, and the gain kinetics parameters (p < .017). Baseline V˙O2 was higher during GUMCAF than GUMPLA (p = .020). No significant effects occurred for the interaction between gum and bout in any parameter of V˙O2 or HHb + Mb kinetics.

Fifteen trained male cyclists participated in four visits. Each visit involved two severe-intensity cycling bouts (Δ1 and Δ2) lasting 6 min, separated by a 5-min recovery period. Muscle fatigue was assessed by isometric maximal voluntary knee extension contraction (IMVC) with twitch interpolation technique and dynamically by 7 s all-out cycling sprints. Assessments were performed before GUMCAF (Pre-GUM) and after the cycling bouts (Post-Exercise). GUMCAF and placebo gum (GUMPLA) were administered in a randomized double-blind procedure with participants receiving each gum type (GUMCAF and GUMPLA) during two separate visits. The results showed no significant interaction between gum types and time for the isometric and dynamic measurements (p > 0.05). The percentage change in performance from Pre-GUM to Post-Exercise showed no significant difference between GUMCAF and GUMPLA for either the dynamic-derived TMAX (~ -17.8% and -15.1%, respectively; p = 0.551) or isometric IMVC (~ -12.3% and -17.7%, respectively; p = 0.091) measurements. Moderate to large correlations (r = 0.31-0.51) were found between changes in sprint maximal torque and maximal power output measurements and isometric force, for both gum conditions. GUMCAF was not effective in attenuating muscle force decline triggered by severe-intensity cycling exercises, as measured by both isometric and dynamic methods. The correlations between IMVC and cycling maximal torque and power output suggest caution when interpreting isometric force as a direct measure of fatigue during dynamic cycling exercises.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nascimento E M.F; Borszcz F K; Ventura T P; Denadai B S; Guglielmo L G.A; de Lucas R D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00421-024-05617-w","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncycling\r\ncyclist\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nexercise\r\nfatigue\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nisometric exercise\r\nmale\r\nmuscle fatigue\r\nmuscle function\r\nmuscle strength\r\nmuscle twitch\r\nneuromuscular function\r\nnormal human\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\ntorque","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nascimento E M.F, Borszcz F K, Ventura T P, Denadai B S, Guglielmo L G.A, and de Lucas R D (2024) The effect of caffeine chewing gum on muscle performance and fatigue after severe-intensity exercise: isometric vs. dynamic assessments in trained cyclists.

Method: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial that included 60 children aged 7–18 years who underwent an appendectomy at the Pediatric Surgery Clinic of a tertiary hospital between April and June 2022. Data for this study were collected via the developed information form, which included participants' descriptive characteristics and bowel function parameters, and the Baxter Retching Faces (BARF) nausea scale. Children in the study group who underwent an appendectomy were given chewing gum and asked to chew it for an average of 15 min, whereas those in the control group received no intervention. Results: The BARF nausea score measured during the menthol gum chewing period was lower in the study group, and the difference score value calculated after pretest time was higher in the study group, as expected (p < 0.001). Moreover, menthol gum chewing was found to shorten hospital stay by 1 day (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Menthol gum chewing reduced the severity of postoperative nausea and length of hospital stay.

Methods: The present study was conducted as single-blind clinical trial in Besat Hospital of Sanandaj, Iran, 2017. Ninty three male patients undergoing skeletal traction were randomly selected by using sealed envelopes with the capability of replacing the envelopes. They were then divided into three groups: sugar-free chewing gum group, abdominal massage group, and control group. After seven days of intervention, the patients' rate of incidence and severity of constipation was measured based on Rome III questionnaire. The data were then analyzed using Kolmogorov Smirnov test and chi-squared test using SPSS-23. Results: The incidence rate of constipation in sugar-free chewing gum group, abdominal massage group, and control group was 23.7%, 37.3%, and 39% respectively. The findings indicated that the incidence of constipation in sugar-free chewing gum group as well abdominal massage group was much less than that of the control group, and this statistical difference was significant (P=0.034).

METHOD: Eleven male cyclists (32.2 ± 7.5 y, 74.3 ± 6.8 kg, 60.2 ± 4.0 mL · kg-1 · min-1 VO2peak) performed 4 experimental trials consisting of 90-min constant-load cycling at 80% of their second ventilatory threshold (207 ± 30 W), followed immediately by a 20-km TT. Under double-blinded conditions, cyclists received placebo (PLA), CHO, CAF, or a combined CHO+CAF chewing gum at 0-, 5-, 10-, and 15-km points of the TT. RESULTS: Overall TT performance was similar across experimental and PLA trials (%mean difference ± 90%CL 0.2% ± 2.0%, 0.4% ± 2.2%, 0.1% ± 1.8% for CHO, CAF, and CHO+CAF). Compared with PLA, mean power output tended to be higher in the first 2 quarters of the TT with CHO (1.6% ± 3.1% and 0.8% ± 2.0%) and was substantially improved in the last 2 quarters during CAF and CHO+CAF trials (4.2% ± 3.0% and 2.0% ± 1.8%). There were no differences in average heart rate (ES <0.2) and only small changes in blood glucose (ES 0.2), which were unrelated to performance.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynaecological laparoscopy are a “high volume” procedure commonly performed in young females expecting rapid resumption of health. The aim of this study was to assess whether it was possible to improve patients’ self-assessed quality of recovery in female patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by simple perioperative measures in the form of a preoperative 200 ml nutritional drink and chewing gum during early recovery. Methods: Patients were randomised to an active group receiving the intervention, and controls provided with standard care only. Patients were followed by questionnaire interviews preoperatively and at 2, 24 and 48 h after surgery. The Quality of Recovery scale (QoR) 15 items and 5 additional questions around gastro-intestinal symptoms were self-assessed by patients at each occasion. Result: Seventy-three ASA 1–2 female patients’ undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery were included, surgery and anaesthesia was uneventful. The QoR score was significantly higher both at 24 and 48 h, 113 SD 20 vs 101 SD 25 (p = 0.026) and 123 SD 13 vs 111 SD 13 (p = 0.006) in the active group of patients as compared to controls. Conclusion: Simply providing 200 ml nutritional preoperative drink and chewing gum during recovery was found effective, improving patients assessed quality of recovery.","Comments":"2019-07-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Öbrink E; Lerström J; Hillström C; Oddby E; Jakobsson J G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.amsu.2019.05.010","Keywords":"xylitol\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nanesthesia\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nbreathing reflex\r\nchewing gum\r\ncholecystectomy\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncohort analysis\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndaily life activity\r\ndepression\r\ndizziness\r\nfemale\r\ngastrointestinal disease\r\nhealth care quality\r\nhuman\r\ninterview\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nnausea and vomiting\r\nopen study\r\npain intensity\r\npriority journal\r\nprophylaxis\r\nprospective study\r\nquestionnaire\r\nself care\r\nsleep quality\r\nwork capacity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Öbrink E, Lerström J, Hillström C, Oddby E, and Jakobsson J G (2019) Can simple perioperative measures improve quality of recovery following ambulatory laparoscopic surgery in females?

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different types of herbal gums on POST management. DESIGN: A randomized controlled, blinded, prospective, experimental study. METHODS: This study was carried out between June and October 2023 in a research and training hospital. A total of 72 patients scheduled for cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in the preoperative period: control, mastic, xylitol, and propolis groups. No intervention was applied to the control group, while patients in the experimental groups chewed either mastic-flavored, xylitol, or propolis gum. Patients in the experimental groups chewed sugar-free gum for 15 minutes immediately before surgery. The incidence and severity of sore throat were evaluated upon admission to the postanesthesia recovery unit and at the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. Descriptive statistics, χ2, Fisher's Exact, Independent samples t test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in the analysis of the data. FINDINGS: There was no significant difference in POST severity between the groups at admission to the postanesthesia recovery unit and at the 1st, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. However, the rate (P: .007) and the median POST score (P: .046) in the propolis group were significantly lower than that of the other groups at the 2 hours postoperatively. Additionally, throat dryness in the propolis group was significantly lower at the first (P: .046) and second (P: .023) hour after surgery compared to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chewing sugar-free gum containing propolis effectively reduces sore throat and throat dryness within the first 2 hours after surgery.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Okgün Alcan; A; Akdağ D; Aygün H; Kebabçı E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jopan.2024.10.019","Keywords":"mastic\r\nsugar\r\nxylitol\r\narticle\r\ncholecystectomy\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndry throat\r\nendotracheal intubation\r\nexperimental study\r\nFisher exact test\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\nKruskal Wallis test\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\npreoperative period\r\npropolis\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsore throat","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Okgün Alcan, A, Akdağ D, Aygün H, and Kebabçı E (2025) Does Preoperative Gum Chewing Reduce Postoperative Sore Throat?.

Chewing gum after a nitrate-rich meal may upregulate the reduction of oral nitrate to nitrite and increase nitric oxide (NO), a molecule important to cardiovascular and neurocognitive health. We aimed to explore effects of chewing gum after a nitrate-rich meal on nitrate metabolism (through the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway), endothelial function, blood pressure (BP), neurocognitive performance, mood and anxiety. Methods: Twenty healthy men (n = 6) and women (n = 14) with a mean age of 48 years (range: 23–69) were recruited to a randomized controlled cross-over trial. After consumption of a nitrate-rich meal (180 mg of nitrate), we assessed the acute effects of chewing gum, compared to no gum chewing, on (i) salivary nitrate, nitrite and the nitrate reductase ratio (100 x [nitrite]/([nitrate] + [nitrite]); (ii) plasma nitrite, S-nitrosothiols and other nitroso species (RXNO); (iii) endothelial function (measured by flow mediated dilatation); (iv) BP; (v) neurocognitive performance; (vi) mood; and (vii) anxiety. Results: Consumption of the nitrate-rich meal resulted in a significant increase in markers of nitrate metabolism. A significantly higher peak flow mediated dilatation was observed with chewing compared to no chewing (baseline adjusted mean difference: 1.10%, 95% CI: 0.06, 2.14; p = 0.038) after the nitrate-rich meal. A significant small increase in systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate were observed with chewing compared to no chewing after the nitrate-rich meal. The study did not observe increased oral reduction of nitrate to nitrite and NO, or improvements in neurocognitive performance, mood or anxiety with chewing compared to no chewing. Conclusion: Chewing gum after a nitrate-rich meal resulted in an acute improvement in endothelial function and a small increase in BP but did not result in acute effects on neurocognitive function, mood or anxiety.","Comments":"2022-10-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ong S; Bondonno N P; Downey L A; Scholey A; Smith M A; Stough C; Blekkenhorst L C; Woodman R; Croft K D; Hodgson J M; Bondonno C P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/07315724.2020.1869119","Keywords":"ACTRN12610001048077\r\nAgilent 6890\r\nanalytical equipment\r\nHitachi 917\r\nmass spectrometer\r\nantifoaming agent\r\nnitrate\r\nnitrate reductase\r\nnitric oxide\r\nnitrite\r\npotassium iodide\r\ns nitrosothiol\r\nadult\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nblood pressure\r\nchemoluminescence\r\nchewing gum\r\ncholesterol blood level\r\nclinical article\r\ncognition\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndiastolic blood pressure\r\ndiet\r\ndilatation\r\nelectrocardiography\r\nfemale\r\nhealth\r\nheart rate\r\nhigh density lipoprotein cholesterol level\r\nhuman\r\nlow density lipoprotein cholesterol level\r\nmale\r\nmean arterial pressure\r\nmiddle aged\r\nmood\r\nneurocognitive performance\r\nnitrate metabolism\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsaliva\r\nsimple reaction time\r\nsystolic blood pressure\r\ntriacylglycerol blood level\r\nAgilent 6890\r\nHitachi 917","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ong S, Bondonno N P, Downey L A, Scholey A, Smith M A, Stough C, Blekkenhorst L C, Woodman R, Croft K D, Hodgson J M, and Bondonno C P (2022) Effects of Chewing Gum on Nitric Oxide Metabolism, Markers of Cardiovascular Health and Neurocognitive Performance after a Nitrate-Rich Meal.

Randomized controlled trials in which a treatment group that chewed gum was compared to a control group that fasted were included. Relevant data, including main outcomes of gastric fluid volume and gastric pH, were extracted. Results Four studies involving 287 patients were included. The presence of chewing gum was associated with small but statically significant increases in gastric fluid volume (mean difference = 0.21 mL/kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.39; P =.03) but not in gastric pH (mean difference = 0.11 mL/kg; 95% confidence interval, - 0.14 to 0.36; P =.38). Gastric fluid volume and gastric pH remained unchanged in subgroup analysis by either sugar or sugarless gum type. Conclusions Chewing gum in the perioperative period causes small but statically significant increases in gastric fluid volume and no change in gastric pH. The increase in gastric fluid most likely is of no clinical significance in terms of aspiration risk for the patient.

DESIGN: A three-arm randomized controlled trial. METHODS: After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned in three groups. The random assignment was performed by using a computer program (Microsoft Excel 2016). Afterward, participants were categorized into three subgroups. Group 3 was the control group that consisted of participants who had no intervention for chewing gum (n = 25). Group 2 was xylitol-free gum chewing group (n = 25), whereas Group 1 was xylitol gum chewing group (n = 24). In later phases, the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, time to first postsurgical defecation, time to first mobilization after surgery, and discharge time from hospital were recorded. Nausea and vomiting, which are among the postoperative symptoms, were also evaluated. FINDINGS: The duration of the control group from the end of surgery to the flatulence and bowel sounds was statistically higher than the xylitol group and xylitol-free group (all P < .05). Also, first postoperative flatulence time of xylitol-free group was higher than the xylitol group (P < .05). The duration from the end of surgery to defecation was longer in the control group compared with the xylitol group and the xylitol-free group, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < .05). In this study, a statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, and time to first postsurgical defecation (all P < .000). No significant difference was found between the xylitol group, xylitol-free group, and control group when discharge from hospital and mobilization times were analyzed (all of them are P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing xylitol gum facilitates postoperative gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further studies are recommended to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Özkan E; Albayrak T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jopan.2024.10.010","Keywords":"xylitol\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncomplication\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\ndiagnosis\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nduration\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nhuman\r\nintestine sound\r\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nmobilization\r\nnausea and vomiting\r\noperation duration\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Özkan E, and Albayrak T (2025) Efficacy of Chewing Xylitol Gum on Restoring Postoperative Bowel Activity After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Three-arm Randomized Controlled Trial.

Background: Previous studies suggested that chewing gum before traditional postoperative care promotes the postoperative recovery of bowel motility and function after open and laparoscopic surgery. However, gum chewing combined with a semi-liquid diet has not been reported in postoperative care of patients following gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery. Design: A prospective randomised study. Methods: Total 234 patients were randomly assigned after elective gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery to a gum chewing and semi-liquid diet group, a semi-liquid only diet group or a liquid diet group. The gum chewing and semi-liquid diet group chewed sugar-free gum with an oral intake of a semi-liquid diet six hours postoperatively. The semi-liquid only diet and liquid diet groups received a semi-liquid diet or a liquid diet, respectively. The time to first bowel sounds, time to first regular postoperative bowel sounds, time to first passage of flatus, time to first defecation, serum gastrin and incidences of hunger, nausea, vomiting and abdominal distension were recorded. Hunger and gastrointestinal sensations were assessed using a four-point scale. Serum gastrin was assayed pre- and postoperatively using a gastrin radioimmunoassay kit. Results: The gum chewing and semi-liquid diet group had first bowel sounds, first regular bowel sounds, first passage of flatus and first defecation earlier than the semi-liquid only and liquid groups. Increased serum gastrin was observed in the gum chewing and semi-liquid diet group. Incidences of nausea, vomiting and abdominal distention were not significantly different between these groups. Conclusion: Chewing gum combined with an oral intake of a semi-liquid diet is safe and accelerates the postoperative recovery of bowel function. It might be recommended as a better postoperative care regimen for patients after gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery.

Objective: We report the application of ERAS to patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). Design, setting, and participants: Prospective collection of outcomes from consecutive patients undergoing RC at a single institution. Intervention: Twenty-six components including prehabilitation exercise, same day admission, carbohydrate fluid loading, targeted intraoperative fluid resuscitation, regional local anaesthesia, cessation of nasogastric tubes, omitting oral bowel preparation, avoiding drain use, early mobilisation, chewing gum use, and audit. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Primary outcomes were length of stay and readmission rate. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rates, survival, and histopathological findings. Results and limitations: Four hundred and fifty-three consecutive patients underwent RC, including 393 (87%) with ERAS. Length of stay was shorter with ERAS (median [interquartile range]: 8 [6–13] d) than without (18 [13–25], p < 0.001). Patients with ERAS had lower blood loss (ERAS: 600 [383–969] ml vs 1050 [900–1575] ml for non-ERAS, p < 0.001), lower transfusion rates (ERAS: 8.1% vs 25%, chi-square test, p < 0.001), and fewer readmissions (ERAS: 15% vs 25%, chi-square test, p = 0.04) than those without. Histopathological parameters (eg, tumour stage, node count, and margin state) and survival outcomes did not differ with ERAS use (all p > 0.1). Multivariable analysis revealed ERAS use was (p = 0.002) independently associated with length of stay. Conclusions: The use of ERAS pathways was associated with lower intraoperative blood loss and faster discharge for patients undergoing RC. These changes did not increase readmission rates or alter oncological outcomes. Patient summary: Recovery after major bladder surgery can be improved by using enhanced recovery pathways. Patients managed by these pathways have shorter length of stays, lower blood loss, and lower transfusion rates. Their adoption should be encouraged. We found that changes to the radical cystectomy recovery pathway made dramatic improvements to patient outcomes. In particular, changing recovery pathways lead to shorter length of stay, lower blood loss and transfusion rates, and fewer readmissions after surgery, without impacting on cancer treatment outcomes.","Comments":"2018-02-23","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pang K H; Groves R; Venugopal S; Noon A P; Catto J W.F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.eururo.2017.07.031","Keywords":"drain\r\nileal conduit\r\nnasogastric tube\r\nneobladder\r\npolydioxanone suture\r\nurinary diversion\r\nantineoplastic agent\r\nhemoglobin\r\nlocal anesthetic agent\r\nadjuvant chemotherapy\r\nadjuvant therapy\r\nadult\r\nage\r\naged\r\nanemia\r\narticle\r\nbladder reconstruction\r\nblood transfusion\r\nbody mass\r\ncancer mortality\r\ncancer palliative therapy\r\ncancer specific survival\r\ncancer staging\r\ncancer surgery\r\ncandy\r\ncarbohydrate loading diet\r\nCharlson Comorbidity Index\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncohort analysis\r\nconvalescence\r\ncystectomy\r\ndiet restriction\r\nenhanced recovery after surgery\r\nestimated glomerular filtration rate\r\nexercise\r\nfemale\r\nfluid intake\r\nfollow up\r\nhistopathology\r\nhospital admission\r\nhospital readmission\r\nhuman\r\nhydronephrosis\r\nincision\r\nintervention study\r\nintestine preparation\r\nkidney function\r\nlength of stay\r\nlocal anesthesia\r\nlymph node count\r\nlymphatic parameters\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmortality rate\r\nmuscle invasive bladder cancer\r\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy\r\nnon muscle invasive bladder cancer\r\nobesity\r\noperation duration\r\noperative blood loss\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient counseling\r\npractice guideline\r\npreoperative evaluation\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nrectus abdominis muscle\r\nrobot assisted surgery\r\nsex\r\nsurgical margin\r\nsurgical patient\r\nsurvival analysis\r\ntransurethral resection\r\nunderweight\r\nvery elderly\r\nwound closure","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pang K H, Groves R, Venugopal S, Noon A P, and Catto J W.F (2018) Prospective Implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocols to Radical Cystectomy.

Strategies to enhance the satiety value of lunch and reduce afternoon snacking are of interest for body weight management.To assess whether between-meal gum chewing would enhance the satiety response to a fixed lunch meal; and assess the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) as a potential mediator of the response in non-obese healthy weight and obese women.Fifty unrestrained obese (n = 25) and non-obese healthy weight (n = 25) women participated in a two-arm cross-over study assessing multiple (15 min per hour × 3 h) gum chewing (GUM) occurrences or no gum (Control) on subjective ratings of satiety, subsequent sweet and salty snack intake, CCK and general metabolic responses.GUM compared to Control resulted in significant suppression of hunger, desire to eat and prospective consumption (p < 0.05). Total snack energy intake was reduced ~. 9.3% by GUM, but not significantly different from Control (p = 0.08). However, overall carbohydrate intake was reduced by GUM (p = 0.03). This was consistent with a reduction in snacks characterized as high carbohydrate, low fat (p = 0.02). BMI specific effects indicated GUM reduced pretzel intake in obese women (p = 0.05) and Oreo cookie intake in healthy weight women (p = 0.03) 3 h after lunch. Metabolic responses and CCK did not differ between experimental conditions.Chewing gum intermittently post-lunch enhances perceptions of satiety and may have important implications in reducing afternoon high carbohydrate-snack intake.","Comments":"2016-04-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Park E; Edirisinghe I; Inui T; Kergoat S; Kelley M; Burton-Freeman B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.002","Keywords":"NCT01316991\r\ncarbohydrate\r\ncholecystokinin\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbody mass\r\nbody weight\r\ncaloric intake\r\ncarbohydrate intake\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\nfast food\r\nfemale\r\nfood intake\r\nhuman\r\nhunger\r\nlow fat diet\r\nmediator release\r\nmetabolism\r\nobesity\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsatiety","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Park E, Edirisinghe I, Inui T, Kergoat S, Kelley M, and Burton-Freeman B (2016) Short-term effects of chewing gum on satiety and afternoon snack intake in healthy weight and obese women.

Data Sources: A literature search was performed using Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of gum chewing after gynecologic surgery in which the main outcomes measured were time to first flatus, time to defecation, and length of hospital stay. Data Extraction: Data on authors, country, randomization method, the type of disease, surgical and anesthetic methods, sample characteristics such as age and body mass index, gum chewing program, and study results were extracted from selected articles. Data Synthesis: Of 493 publications, eight RCTs conducted between 2013 and 2017 involving 1,077 women were included in our meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the eight studies with the use of Cochrane Review Manager Version 5.3 (RevMan; 2014). The pooled results showed that gum chewing was superior to no gum chewing, with a reduction in WMD for time to first flatus of −6.20 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] [−9.51, −2.88]), WMD for time to first defecation of −9.03 hours (95% CI [−14.02, −4.04]), and WMD for length of hospital stay of −0.36 days (95% CI [−0.72, −0.01]). Conclusion: Gum chewing significantly reduced the time to first flatus and defecation after gynecologic surgery and should be recommended by health care providers. © 2018 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Park S H; Choi M S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Park S H, and Choi M S (2018) Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Gum Chewing After Gynecologic Surgery.

This study evaluates the effects of reducing POI and AL via perioperative gum chewing compared to placebo (control) on in-hospital costs, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and assesses cost-effectiveness. METHODS: In patients undergoing elective, open colorectal surgery, changes in HRQoL were assessed using EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaires and costs were estimated from a hospital perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. RESULTS: In 112 patients, mean costs for ward stay were significantly lower in the gum chewing group when compared to control (€3522 (95% CI €3034-€4010) versus €4893 (95% CI €3843-€5942), respectively, p = .020). No differences were observed in mean overall in-hospital costs, or in mean change in any of the HRQoL scores or utilities. Gum chewing was dominant (less costly and more effective) compared to the control in more than 50% of the simulations for both POI and AL. CONCLUSION: Reducing POI and AL via gum chewing reduced costs for ward stay, but did not affect overall in-hospital costs, HRQoL, or mapped utilities.

A transient impairment of bowel motility is expected after CS. Although this usually resolves spontaneously within a few days, it can cause considerable discomfort, require symptomatic medication and delay hospital discharge, thus increasing costs. Chewing gum in the immediate postoperative period is a simple intervention that may be effective in enhancing recovery of bowel function in other types of abdominal surgeries. Objectives: To assess the effects of chewing gum to reduce the duration of postoperative ileus and to enhance postoperative recovery after a CS. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 June 2016), LILACs (20 June 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 June 2016), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (20 June 2016) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing chewing gum versus usual care, for women in the first 24 hours after a CS. We included studies published in abstract form only. Quasi-randomised, cross-over or cluster-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias following standard Cochrane methods. We present dichotomous outcome results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcome results as mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We pooled the results of similar studies using a random-effects model in case of important heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence. Main results: We included 17 randomised trials (3149 participants) conducted in nine different countries. Seven studies (1325 women) recruited exclusively women undergoing elective CS and five studies (833 women) only included women having a primary CS. Ten studies (1731 women) used conventional feeding protocols (nil by mouth until the return of intestinal function). The gum-chewing regimen varied among studies, in relation to its initiation (immediately after CS, up to 12 hours later), duration of each session (from 15 to 60 minutes) and number of sessions per day (three to more than six). All the studies were classified as having a high risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention, women could not be blinded and most of the outcomes were self-reported. Primary outcomes of this review: for the women that chewed gum, the time to passage of first flatus was seven hours shorter than those women in the 'usual care' control group (MD -7.09 hours, 95% CI -9.27 to -4.91 hours; 2399 women; 13 studies; random-effects Tau2 = 14.63, I2 = 95%, very low-quality evidence). This effect was consistent in all subgroup analyses (primary and repeat CS, time spent chewing gum per day, early and conventional feeding protocols, elective and non-elective CS and time after CS when gum-chewing was initiated). The rate of ileus was on average over 60% lower in the chewing-gum group compared to the control (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 1139 participants; four studies; I2 = 39%, low-quality evidence). Tolerance to gum-chewing appeared to be high. Three women in one study complained about the chewing gum (but no further information was provided) and none of the studies reported adverse effects (eight studies, 925 women, low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes of this review: the time to passage of faeces occurred on average nine hours earlier in the intervention group (MD -9.22 hours, 95% CI -11.49 to -6.95 hours; 2016 participants; 11 studies; random-effects Tau2 = 12.53, I2 = 93%, very low-quality evidence). The average duration of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention compared to the control group (MD -0.36 days, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.18 days; 1489 participants; seven studies; random-effects Tau2 = 0.04, I2 = 92%). The first intestinal sounds were heard earlier in the intervention than in the control group (MD -4.56 hours, 95% CI -6.18 to -2.93 hours; 1729 participants; nine studies; random-effects Tau2 = 5.41, I2 = 96%). None of the studies assessed women's satisfaction in relation to having to chew gum. The need for analgesia or antiemetic agents did not differ between the intervention and control groups (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.13; 726 participants; three studies; random-effects Tau2 = 0.79, I2 = 69%). Authors' conclusions: This review found 17 randomised controlled trials (involving 3149 women). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for time to first passage of flatus and of faeces and for adverse effects/intolerance to gum chewing because of the high risk of bias of the studies (due to lack of blinding and self-report). For time to first flatus and faeces, we downgraded the quality of the evidence further because of the high heterogeneity in these meta-analyses and the potential for publication bias based on the visual inspection of the funnel plots. The quality of the evidence for adverse effects/tolerance to gum chewing and for ileus was downgraded because of the small number of events. The quality of the evidence for ileus was further downgraded due to the unclear risk of bias for the assessors evaluating this outcome. The available evidence suggests that gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period after a CS is a well tolerated intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function. However the overall quality of the evidence is very low to low. Further research is necessary to establish the optimal regimen of gum-chewing (initiation, number and duration of sessions per day) to enhance bowel function recovery and to assess potential adverse effects of and women's satisfaction with this intervention. New studies also need to assess the compliance of the participants to the recommended gum-chewing instructions. Future large, well designed and conducted studies, with better methodological and reporting quality, will help to inform future updates of this review and enhance the body of evidence for this intervention.","Comments":"2016-11-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pereira Gomes Morais; E; Riera R; Porfírio G J.M; Macedo C R; Sarmento Vasconcelos; V; de Souza Pedrosa A; Torloni M R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD011562.pub2","Keywords":"analgesic agent\r\nantiemetic agent\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ndefecation\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nhuman\r\nintestine function\r\nlength of stay\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative period\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pereira Gomes Morais, E, Riera R, Porfírio G J.M, Macedo C R, Sarmento Vasconcelos, V, de Souza Pedrosa A, and Torloni M R (2016) Chewing gum for enhancing early recovery of bowel function after caesarean section.

We postulated that nicotine enhances related auditory processing in humans. OBJECTIVES: The main hypothesis was that nicotine improves auditory performance. A secondary hypothesis was that the degree of nicotine-induced improvement depends on the individual's baseline performance. METHODS: Young (18-27 years old), normal-hearing nonsmokers received nicotine (Nicorette gum, 6mg) or placebo gum in a single-blind, randomized, crossover design. Subjects performed four experiments involving tone-in-noise detection, temporal gap detection, spectral ripple discrimination, and selective auditory attention before and after treatment. The perceptual differences between posttreatment nicotine and placebo conditions were measured and analyzed as a function of the pre-treatment baseline performance. RESULTS: Nicotine significantly improved performance in the more difficult tasks of tone-in-noise detection and selective attention (effect size = - 0.3) but had no effect on relatively easier tasks of temporal gap detection and spectral ripple discrimination. The two tasks showing significant nicotine effects further showed no baseline-dependent improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine improves auditory performance in difficult listening situations. The present results support future investigation of nicotine effects in clinical populations with auditory processing deficits or reduced cholinergic activation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pham CQ; Kapolowicz MR; Metherate R; Zeng FG; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-019-05421-x ","Keywords":"Acoustic Stimulation/methods/psychology\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAttention/drug effects/physiology\r\nAuditory Perception/*drug effects/physiology\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHealthy Volunteers\r\nHearing/*drug effects/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNicotine/*administration & dosage\r\n*Nicotine Chewing Gum\r\nNon-Smokers/*psychology\r\nOximetry/methods\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAcetylcholinergic systems\r\nAuditory processing\r\nNicotine\r\nSelective attention\r\nSpectral ripple discrimination\r\nTemporal gap detection\r\nTone in noise detection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pham CQ, Kapolowicz MR, Metherate R, and Zeng FG (2020) Nicotine enhances auditory processing in healthy and normal-hearing young adult nonsmokers..

This interventional study was conducted on 40 patients undergoing cholecystectomy in Jiroft University of Medical Sciences, 2012. After surgery, they were randomly allocated to intervention (gum chewing) and control groups. Patients in the intervention group chewed sugar free gum 3 times a day for an hour each time after full consciousness. The first bowel sounds, flatus passage and defecation were recorded in both groups. Data were analyzed using student T-test. The first gas passing was reported 21.05±12.8 and 40.8±15.9 hours following operation in intervention and control groups, respectively. The first defection was occurred 38.1±29.8 and58.25±18.6 hours after operation in intervention and control groups, respectively. The first bowel sounds were heard 4±1.02 and 4.9±1.3 hours post-operatively in intervention and control groups, respectively. In all three cases, the difference between two groups was statistically significant. With regard to the results, gum chewing is an inexpensive and useful approach that reduces paralytic ileus following cholecystectomy.","Comments":"2016-06-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pilevarzadeh M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.13005/bpj/952","Keywords":"abdominal surgery\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncholecystectomy\r\nclinical article\r\ncolectomy\r\nconsciousness\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nintervention study\r\nintestine sound\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nmiddle aged\r\nparalytic ileus\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pilevarzadeh M (2016) Effect of gum chewing in the reduction of paralytic ileus following cholecystectomy.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of early absorption sources containing caffeine on the performance of female table tennis players. METHOD: Eighteen female table tennis players randomly participated in this randomized, double-blind, and crossover designed study. Before starting the test, the participants attended a familiarization session. In each test session, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions including chewing caffeinated gum (CG, n = 6), coffee mouth rinsing (CMR, n = 6) and placebo capsule (PLA, n = 6). All participants consumed caffeine with an average dose of ∼3 to 4.5 mg·kg(-1). The one-week interval was considered a washout period for each condition. Each test session included measurement of functional, skill and cognitive tests. Skill tests included serve, forehand drive, backhand push and counter tests. The Cognitive function measured by color recognition test, and functional tests included agility, hand movement speed, the explosive power of the upper body and lower body, hand-eye coordination and hand grip strength tests. The collected data were analyzed (with SPSS Windows software) by repeated measure ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni post hoc test at P ≤ 0.05 level. RESULTS: The findings of the present study illustrated that CG and CMR increased significantly agility and reduced the amounts of errors in the cognitive test compared to PLA (p < 0.05), While there was no significant difference between CG and CMR (p > 0.05). Also, CG and CMR compared to PLA and CMR compared to CG rose significantly hand movement speed and movement speed (p < 0.05), and CMR compared to PLA increased significantly hand-eye coordination, isometric hand strength, service accuracy and forehand drive (p < 0.05). However, CG compared to PLA and CMR had no significant effect on hand-eye coordination, isometric hand strength, service accuracy and forehand drive (p > 0.05). In addition, CG and CMR enhanced significantly the explosive power of the lower body compared to PLA (p < 0.05), While there was no significant difference between CG and CMR (p > 0.05). Also, CG and CMR compared to PLA and CG compared to CMR had no significant effect on the explosive power of the upper body, backhand, and counter skills (p > 0.05). Furthermore, CG increased significantly accuracy in the service test compared to PLA (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results, it seems that early absorption sources of caffeine (CMR and CG) are efficient strategies for improving the specific performance of female table tennis players. However, allegedly CMR and CG have a better effect on functional and cognitive tests compared to skill tests.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pirmohammadi S; Hemmatinafar M; Nemati J; Imanian B; Abdollahi MH; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15502783.2023.2282051 ","Keywords":"Female\r\nHumans\r\n*Athletic Performance\r\nCaffeine\r\nChewing Gum\r\nCoffee\r\nHand Strength\r\nMouthwashes\r\nPolyesters\r\n*Tennis\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nTable tennis\r\ncaffeinated gum\r\ncoffee mouth rinsing\r\nexplosive power\r\nfemale athletes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pirmohammadi S, Hemmatinafar M, Nemati J, Imanian B, and Abdollahi MH (2023) Early absorption sources of caffeine can be a useful strategy for improving female table tennis players-specific performance..

Methods: Randomised controlled trials involving any non-surgical, perioperative interventions designed to support or improve the patient experience for patients undergoing cystectomy procedures were reviewed. Comparison groups included those exposed to usual clinical care or standard procedure. Studies were excluded if they involved surgical procedure only, involved bowel preparation only or involved an alternative therapy such as aromatherapy. Any short and long-term outcomes reflecting the patient experience or related urological health outcomes were considered. Results: Nineteen articles (representing 15 individual studies) were included for review. Heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes across studies meant meta-analyses were not possible. Participants were all patients with bladder cancer and interventions were delivered over different stages of the perioperative period. The overall quality of evidence and reporting was low and outcomes were predominantly measured in the short-term. However, the findings show potential for exercise therapy, pharmaceuticals, ERAS protocols, psychological/educational programmes, chewing gum and nutrition to benefit a broad range of physiological and psychological health outcomes. Conclusions: Supportive interventions to date have taken many different forms with a range of potentially meaningful physiological and psychological health outcomes for cystectomy patients. Questions remain as to what magnitude of short-term health improvements would lead to clinically relevant changes in the overall patient experience of surgery and long-term recovery.","Comments":"2018-12-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Quirk H; Rosario D J; Bourke L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12894-018-0382-z","Keywords":"alternative medicine\r\naromatherapy\r\nbladder cancer\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical outcome\r\nclinical protocol\r\ncystectomy\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nhealth status\r\nhuman\r\nintermethod comparison\r\nintestine preparation\r\nkinesiotherapy\r\nmental health\r\nnutrition\r\npatient care\r\npatient education\r\nperioperative period\r\nperioperative supportive intervention\r\npersonal experience\r\npharmaceutical care\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Quirk H, Rosario D J, and Bourke L (2018) Supportive interventions to improve physiological and psychological health outcomes among patients undergoing cystectomy: A systematic review.

Caffeinated gum has attracted interest as a novel vehicle for delivering caffeine, because absorption of caffeine from gum is quick. Rapid absorption of caffeine may be useful during rugby matches when there is limited time for supplementation such as at half-time or when substitutes enter play. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a low dose of caffeine in gum improves performance in a battery of rugby-specific tests. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 17 male university-standard rugby players (mass: 85.6 ± 6.3 kg; height: 179.4 ± 6.2 cm; age: 20.4 ± 1.2 years) chewed caffeinated gum (200 mg caffeine) or a placebo gum on two occasions separated by a week. After a standardized warm-up, gum was chewed for 5 min. Subsequently, participants performed three countermovement jumps, followed by an Illinois agility test, 6 × 30 m repeated sprints, and the Yo-Yo IR-2 test; each test was separated by short rest periods. RESULTS: Caffeinated gum enhanced countermovement jump by 3.6% (caffeine: 43.7 ± 7.6 cm vs. placebo: 42.2 ± 6.2 cm; d = 0.22, 95% CI [0.006, 0.432]; p = 0.044). There was a greater resistance to fatigue during the 6 × 30 m repeated sprint test (fatigue index caffeine: 102.2 ± 0.9% vs. placebo: 103.3 ± 1.2%; d = 1.03, 95% CI [0.430, 1.613]; p = 0.001), and performance on the Yo-Yo IR2 was improved by 14.5% (caffeine: 426 ± 105 m, placebo: 372 ± 91 m; d = 0.55, 95% CI [0.130, 0.957]; p = 0.010). Caffeine gum had no significant effect on the Illinois agility test (caffeine 16.22 ± 1.08 s vs. placebo 15.88 ± 1.09 s; d = - 0.31, 95% CI [- 0.855, 0.240]; p = 0.271). CONCLUSIONS: In university-standard rugby players, a low dose of caffeine (200 mg) supplied in chewing gum enhanced performance on the Yo-Yo IR-2 test and the countermovement jump test and reduced fatigue index during repeated sprints. These improvements in a battery of rugby-specific tests may transfer to enhanced performance in rugby matches.","Comments":"2019-05-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ranchordas M K; Pratt H; Parsons M; Parry A; Boyd C; Lynn A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12970-019-0286-7","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nathletic performance\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nendurance\r\nexercise test\r\nfatigue\r\nfootball\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ranchordas M K, Pratt H, Parsons M, Parry A, Boyd C, and Lynn A (2019) Effect of caffeinated gum on a battery of rugby-specific tests in trained university-standard male rugby union players.

This study assessed the feasibility and outcomes of an ERAS protocol for colorectal surgery implemented over two-years in a small, resource-challenged rural hospital. Study design: A prospective cohort study used retrospectively matched controls to assess the effect of ERAS on LOS in patients undergoing colorectal surgery in a small rural hospital in northern Ontario, Canada. ERAS patients were matched to two patients in the control group based on diagnosis, age and gender. Patients had open or laparoscopic colorectal surgeries, with those in the intervention group treated per ERAS protocol and given instructions on pre- and post-operative self-care. Results: Most ERAS patients reported adherence to ERAS protocols prior to surgery. Approximately one quarter of patients chose not to complete the postoperative survey. Of those who completed the survey, adherence to protocol was strongest for chewing gum in the days after surgery. Most patients were sitting in a chair for their afternoon meal by the first day and most were walking down the hallway by the second day. The control and ERAS patient groups did not differ significantly (p≥0.07) in age (x̄=68.5 years, sd=13.1), gender (52% male), nor in the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions 5-character code.

Although recognised by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society as one of the multimodal approaches to expedite recovery after surgery, strong evidence to support its use in routine postoperative practice is lacking. Methodology: A comprehensive literature review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed in the Medline and Embase databases between 2000 and 2019. Studies were selected to compare the use of chewing gum versus standard care in the management of postoperative ileus (POI) in adults undergoing colorectal surgery. The primary outcome assessed was the incidence of POI. Secondary outcomes included time to passage of flatus, time to defecation, total length of hospital stay and mortality. Results: Sixteen RCTs were included in the systematic review, of which ten (970 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of POI was significantly reduced in patients utilising chewing gum compared to those having standard care (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39, 0.79, p = 0.0009). These patients also had a significant reduction in time to passage of flatus (WMD − 0.31, 95% CI − 0.36, − 0.26, p < 0.00001) and time to defecation (WMD − 0.47, 95% CI − 0.60, − 0.34, p < 0.00001), without significant differences in the total length of hospital stay or mortality. Conclusion: The use of chewing gum after colorectal surgery is a safe and effective intervention in reducing the incidence of POI and merits routine use alongside other ERAS pathways in the postoperative setting. © 2020, The Author(s).","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Roslan F; Kushairi A; Cappuyns L; Daliya P; Adiamah A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Roslan F, Kushairi A, Cappuyns L, Daliya P, and Adiamah A (2020) The Impact of Sham Feeding with Chewing Gum on Postoperative Ileus Following Colorectal Surgery: a Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.

Physiological and performance effects of caffeine gum consumed during a simulated half-time by professional academy rugby union players. J Strength Cond Res 34(1): 145-151, 2020-Despite the prevalence of caffeine (CAF) as an ergogenic aid, few studies have examined the use of caffeinated gums, especially during half-time in team sports. The physiological (blood lactate and salivary hormone concentrations) and performance (repeated sprints and cognitive function) effects of consuming CAF gum during a simulated half-time were examined. Professional academy rugby union players (n = 14) completed this double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced study. After pre-exercise measurements, players chewed a placebo (PLC) gum for 5 minutes before a standardized warm-up and completing repeated sprint testing (RSSA1). Thereafter, during a 15-minute simulated half-time period, players chewed either CAF (400 mg; 4.1 ± 0.5 mg·kg) or PLC gum for 5 minutes before completing a second repeated sprint test (RSSA2). Blood lactate, salivary testosterone and cortisol concentrations, and indices of cognitive function (i.e., reaction time and Stroop test) were measured at baseline, pre-RSSA1, post-RSSA1, pre-RSSA2, and post-RSSA2. Sprint performance was not affected by CAF (p = 0.995) despite slower sprint times after the first sprint of both RSSA tests (all p < 0.002). After half-time, salivary testosterone increased by 70% (+97 ± 58 pg·ml) in CAF vs. PLC (p < 0.001), whereas salivary cortisol remained unchanged (p = 0.307). Cognitive performance was unaffected by time and trial (all p > 0.05). Although performance effects were absent, chewing CAF gum increased the salivary testosterone concentrations of professional rugby union players over a simulated half-time. Practitioners may, therefore, choose to recommend CAF gum between successive exercise bouts because of the increases in salivary testosterone observed; a variable associated with increased motivation and high-intensity exercise performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Russell M; Reynolds NA; Crewther BT; Cook CJ; Kilduff LP; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1519/JSC.0000000000002185 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAthletic Performance/*physiology\r\nCaffeine/*administration & dosage\r\nChewing Gum\r\nCognition\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFootball/*physiology\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/analysis\r\nLactic Acid/blood\r\nMale\r\nPerformance-Enhancing Substances/*administration & dosage\r\nSaliva/chemistry\r\nTestosterone/analysis\r\nWarm-Up Exercise\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Russell M, Reynolds NA, Crewther BT, Cook CJ, and Kilduff LP (2020) Physiological and Performance Effects of Caffeine Gum Consumed During a Simulated Half-Time by Professional Academy Rugby Union Players..

Results: A total of three systematic reviews and three randomised controlled trials were included in the study. The studies show a significant to highly significant effect of gum chewing on postoperative ileus-related outcomes. The trials however in general utilised a weak design. Conclusions: Gum chewing decreases postoperative ileus following colorectal surgery. More robust trials are required to confirm these findings.

This study aimed to determine which measures, such as coffee, chewing gum (CG), electroacupuncture (EA), daikenchuto (DKT), and prokinetic agents, are most effective in reducing postoperative ileus in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgeries. METHODS: A systematic search was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines on Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. The following measures were studied to define postoperative ileus: time to passage of the first flatus and time to passage of the first stool. The mean differences were determined by subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Of 176 studies, 37 were selected for the systematic review, which involved 4647 patients. The reduction in time to passage of the first flatus was -18.33 h (95% CI, -26.46 to -10.20; P <.01) for EA, -5.83 h (95% CI, -9.40 to -2.26; P <.01) for DKT, -14.87 h (95% CI, -26.84 to -2.90; P =.01) for CG, and -1.90 h (95% CI, -8.28 to 4.48; P =.56) for coffee.

Method: Smokers interested in quitting (N = 513; 59% female; 87% White) received nicotine patch plus nicotine gum and participated in a 2x2x2x2x2 randomized factorial experiment (i.e., 32 treatment conditions) evaluating five intervention components: (1) medication adherence counseling versus none; (2) automated medication adherence calls versus none; (3) electronic medication monitoring with feedback and counseling versus e-monitoring alone; (4) 26 versus 8 weeks of nicotine patch plus nicotine gum; and (5) maintenance counseling versus none. Adherence was assessed over the first 6 weeks post-target quit day via timeline follow-back (nicotine patch) and electronic medication dispenser (gum). Results: In the first 6 weeks post-quit day, 12% of participants used no patches or gum, and 40% used the patch every day. Only 1.4% used both patch and gum adherently every day in the 6 weeks post-target quit day. E-monitoring counseling increased gum use (from 1.9 to 2.6 pieces/day; p <.001) but did not increase abstinence. More adherent patch and gum use in the first 6 weeks were each associated with higher point-prevalence abstinence rates through 1 year. Conclusions: This large experiment with electronic monitoring of nicotine gum adherence showed that e-monitoring counseling increased gum use but not abstinence. Adherence to nicotine patch and to gum were each strongly related to abstinence, but it is unclear whether adherence increases abstinence, or relapse causes medication discontinuation.

The alerting effects of bright light offer a potential countermeasure for driver sleepiness, either replacing or in conjunction with current countermeasures such as the use of caffeine. Methods: Thirty young (18–25) chronically sleep-restricted drivers drove in a simulator under randomized conditions of continuous bright light (‘Light,’ 500 nm, 230μw/cm2), caffeine (‘Caffeine,’ 100 mg caffeinated gum), or light and caffeine together (‘Light + Caffeine’), after driving under a placebo condition (‘Placebo,’ decaffeinated gum, 555 nm light, 0.3 μW/cm2) on three consecutive days. Using mixed-effects linear models, the associations between these conditions and physiological outcomes (EEG alpha and theta power, heart rate, and beat-to-beat intervals), driving performance (lateral lane and steering-related outcomes and lateral acceleration), and subjective sleepiness was assessed. Results: Relative to Placebo, all conditions improved driving performance outcomes (P < 0.0001), with effects of Light + Caffeine equal to Light but greater than Caffeine. Light + Caffeine reduced EEG alpha power more than Light or Caffeine (P < 0.0006), but ECG outcomes were generally worse under all conditions relative to Placebo. Subjective sleepiness improved under the Light + Caffeine condition only (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Combining bright light and caffeine enhances their alerting effects on lateral lane variability and subjective sleepiness. A bright light could be a practical alternative to caffeine for sleepy drivers who avoid caffeine. The alerting effects of bright light could alleviate chronic community-level mild sleep restriction and provide on-road benefits to reduce severe injuries and fatal sleepiness-related crashes.","Comments":"2022-05-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shekari Soleimanloo; S; Garcia-Hansen V; White M J; Huda M M; Smith S S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.sleep.2022.03.013","Keywords":"actigraph\r\ndriving simulator\r\ncaffeine\r\nplacebo\r\nacceleration\r\nadult\r\nalertness\r\nalpha rhythm\r\narticle\r\nblue light\r\nbright light\r\ncar driver\r\ncar driving\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncomparative study\r\ncontrolled study\r\nelectroencephalogram\r\nfemale\r\nheart beat\r\nheart rate\r\nhuman\r\nKarolinska Sleepiness Scale\r\nlateral lane driving\r\nlight\r\nmale\r\nrailway\r\nsleep deprivation\r\nsleep disorder assessment\r\nsleep time\r\nsomnolence\r\nsteering related outcome\r\ntheta rhythm","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shekari Soleimanloo, S, Garcia-Hansen V, White M J, Huda M M, and Smith S S (2022) Bright light alone or combined with caffeine improves sleepiness in chronically sleep-restricted young drivers.

Design: Within a 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotine gum, analyses contrasted the outcome of temptation episodes where gum was or was not used. Setting: Smoking cessation research clinic in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Participants: A total of 255 adult ITS (131 nicotine gum, 124 placebo) seeking help for smoking cessation. Intervention: Nicotine gum (2 mg) versus placebo for up to 8 weeks, with as-needed dosing instructions. Measurements: Outcome was lapsing in temptation episodes, as reported by participants via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Propensity scores predicting gum use from situational factors (e.g. mood, social setting, smoking cues) served as a control variable. Findings: Participants reported 2713 temptation episodes, 46.0% (1248) of which resulted in smoking (lapsing). There was a significant gum use × active treatment interaction (P = 0.0009). Using nicotine gum decreased the odds of lapsing by 55% compared with using placebo [odds ratio (OR) = 0.45; 0.22–0.94]; when gum was not used, the assigned gum condition made no significant difference (OR = 1.53; 0.78–3.01; Bayes factor = 0.14). The nicotine effect was not reliably different when participants were trying to achieve abstinence versus when trying to maintain abstinence (OR = 0.44; 0.10, 2.03; P = 0.294; Bayes factor = 0.11), for men and women (OR = 1.68; 0.58, 4.87; P = 0.343; Bayes factor = 0.10), or for participants with some or no dependence (OR = 0.88; 0.30, 2.59; P = 0.811; Bayes factor = 0.06). Conclusions: When used in response to temptation to smoke, 2 mg nicotine gum can help to prevent lapses among non-daily smokers. © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shiffman S; Ferguson S G; Mao J; Scholl S M; Hedeker D; Tindle H A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shiffman S, Ferguson S G, Mao J, Scholl S M, Hedeker D, and Tindle H A (2020) Effectiveness of nicotine gum in preventing lapses in the face of temptation to smoke among non-daily smokers: a secondary analysis.

ITS smoke for nicotine and have trouble quitting, but tend to smoke in particular situations. This study tested the effect of nicotine gum, used to prevent or react to situational temptations, for helping ITS quit. Methods: ITS (smoking 4-27 days/month) seeking help quitting were randomized to 2 mg nicotine gum (n = 181) or placebo (n = 188), to be used to anticipate or react to temptations to smoke, for 8 weeks. Participants received up to six sessions of behavioral counseling. The primary outcome was 6-month biochemically verified continuous abstinence; analyses also examined 14-day point-prevalence abstinence at multiple time points, and used event-history analyses to assess progression to abstinence, lapsing, and relapsing. Analyses adjusted for group differences in age and baseline smoking, and considered several potential moderators of treatment effects. Results: Nicotine gum did not significantly improve outcomes on any measure. Biochemically verified 6-month continuous abstinence rates were 7.2% for active gum and 5.3% for placebo (AOR = 1.39, 0.58-3.29, p >. 25). ITS with any degree of dependence (Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence scores >0) showed poorer outcomes on multiple endpoints, and did more poorly on active gum on some outcomes. Gum use was low, starting at 1 gum per day on average and declining over time. Conclusions: Nicotine gum (2 mg), used intermittently, did not improve cessation rates among ITS, including those demonstrating some degree of dependence. Implications: Nicotine replacement has been extensively tested with daily smokers, especially those who smoke relatively heavily. Nondaily smoking is now common, creating a need for treatment for ITS. Despite evidence that ITS' smoking is motivated by nicotine-seeking, a theoretically and empirically derived situational approach to using acute nicotine replacement was not successful at helping ITS quit. Gum use was low; whether higher or more frequent dosing is needed, or whether an entirely different approach is needed, is not clear. Effective treatment options are needed for ITS, especially those with some degree of dependence. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shiffman S; Scholl S M; Mao J; Ferguson S G; Hedeker D; Primack B; Tindle H A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shiffman S, Scholl S M, Mao J, Ferguson S G, Hedeker D, Primack B, and Tindle H A (2020) Using nicotine gum to assist nondaily smokers in quitting: A randomized clinical trial.

METHODS: Nineteen participants (age: 20.9 ± 1.0 years; height: 175.6 ± 4.9 cm; mass: 66.5 ± 5.6 kg; training age: 7.9 ± 1.0 years) were randomly assigned to either a caffeine trial (CAF) or a placebo trial (PL) using a double-blind, randomized crossover design. The participants in the CAF trial chewed a gum containing 3 mg/kg of caffeine for a period of 10 minutes, while those in the PL trial chewed a gum containing a placebo with no caffeine. Following a 15-minute period of rest, the fatigue index was tested by six maximal 35-meter sprints with a 10-second rest between efforts. After this, at least 30 minutes of rest was permitted, during which time the participants engaged in brief warm-up activities prior to the commencement of the 400-meter sprint test. Saliva samples were collected before chewing gum, before the fatigue test and before 400-meters sprinting. RESULTS: The fatigue index was significantly lower in the CAF trial compared to the PL trial (CAF: 8.1 ± 2.5%; PL: 9.6 ± 4.8%; p = 0.046, Cohen's d = 039). The CAF trial demonstrated significantly lower sprint time for the 300-400 meter segment (CAF: 14.73 ± 1.35 seconds; PL: 15.23 ± 1.30 seconds; p = 0.019, Cohen's d = 0.37) and total sprint time compared to the PL trial (CAF: 53.87 ± 2.88 seconds; PL: 54.68 ± 3.37 seconds; p = 0.003, Cohen's d = 0.27). Saliva caffeine and α-amylase concentration were significantly higher in the CAF trial compared to the PL trial (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that caffeine gum supplementation prior to exercise significantly reduced the fatigue index and increased the capacity to maintain speed, particularly in the final 300 to 400 meters, as well as enhancing 400-meter sprint performance.","Comments":"2024-10-16","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shiu Y J; Chen C H; Tao W S; Nai H F; Yu C Y; Chiu C H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15502783.2024.2414871","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nathletic performance\r\nchemistry\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nfatigue\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nnutrition\r\nphysiology\r\nprevention and control\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrunning\r\nsaliva\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shiu Y J, Chen C H, Tao W S, Nai H F, Yu C Y, and Chiu C H (2024) Acute ingestion of caffeinated chewing gum reduces fatigue index and improves 400-meter performance in trained sprinters: a double-blind crossover trial.

Onset of ileus is considered to be multifactorial, and a variety of preventative methods have been investigated. Chewing gum (CG) is hypothesised to reduce postoperative ileus by stimulating early recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function, through cephalo-vagal stimulation. There is no comprehensive review of this intervention in abdominal surgery. Objectives: To examine whether chewing gum after surgery hastens the return of gastrointestinal function. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and ISI Web of Science (June 2014). We hand-searched reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews and systematic reviews, and contacted CG companies to ask for information on any studies using their products. We identified proposed and ongoing studies from clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and metaRegister of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria: We included completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used postoperative CG as an intervention compared to a control group. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently collected data and assessed study quality using an adapted Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed overall quality of evidence for each outcome using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Studies were split into subgroups: colorectal surgery (CRS), caesarean section (CS) and other surgery (OS). We assessed the effect of CG on time to first flatus (TFF), time to bowel movement (TBM), LOHS and time to bowel sounds (TBS) through meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We investigated the influence of study quality, reviewers' methodological estimations and use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes using sensitivity analyses. We used meta-regression to explore if surgical site or ROB scores predicted the extent of the effect estimate of the intervention on continuous outcomes. We reported frequency of complications, and descriptions of tolerability of gum and cost. Main results: We identified 81 studies that comprised 9072 participants for inclusion in our review. We categorised many studies at high or unclear risk of the bias' assessed. There was statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TFF [overall reduction of 10.4 hours (95% CI: -11.9, -8.9): 12.5 hours (95% CI: -17.2, -7.8) in CRS, 7.9 hours (95% CI: -10.0, -5.8) in CS, 10.6 hours (95% CI: -12.7, -8.5) in OS]. There was also statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TBM [overall reduction of 12.7 hours (95% CI: -14.5, -10.9): 18.1 hours (95% CI: -25.3, -10.9) in CRS, 9.1 hours (95% CI: -11.4, -6.7) in CS, 12.3 hours (95% CI: -14.9, -9.7) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced LOHS [overall reduction of 0.7 days (95% CI: -0.8, -0.5): 1.0 days in CRS (95% CI: -1.6, -0.4), 0.2 days (95% CI: -0.3, -0.1) in CS, 0.8 days (95% CI: -1.1, -0.5) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced TBS [overall reduction of 5.0 hours (95% CI: -6.4, -3.7): 3.21 hours (95% CI: -7.0, 0.6) in CRS, 4.4 hours (95% CI: -5.9, -2.8) in CS, 6.3 hours (95% CI: -8.7, -3.8) in OS]. Effect sizes were largest in CRS and smallest in CS. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity in all analyses other than TBS in CRS. There was little difference in mortality, infection risk and readmission rate between the groups. Some studies reported reduced nausea and vomiting and other complications in the intervention group. CG was generally well-tolerated by participants. There was little difference in cost between the groups in the two studies reporting this outcome. Sensitivity analyses by quality of studies and robustness of review estimates revealed no clinically important differences in effect estimates. Sensitivity analysis of ERAS studies showed a smaller effect size on TFF, larger effect size on TBM, and no difference between groups for LOHS. Meta-regression analyses indicated that surgical site is associated with the extent of the effect size on LOHS (all surgical subgroups), and TFF and TBM (CS and CRS subgroups only). There was no evidence that ROB score predicted the extent of the effect size on any outcome. Neither variable explained the identified heterogeneity between studies. Authors' conclusions: This review identified some evidence for the benefit of postoperative CG in improving recovery of GI function. However, the research to date has primarily focussed on CS and CRS, and largely consisted of small, poor quality trials. Many components of the ERAS programme also target ileus, therefore the benefit of CG alongside ERAS may be reduced, as we observed in this review. Therefore larger, better quality RCTS in an ERAS setting in wider surgical disciplines would be needed to improve the evidence base for use of CG after surgery.","Comments":"2019-01-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Short V; Herbert G; Perry R; Atkinson C; Ness A R; Penfold C; Thomas S; Andersen H K; Lewis S J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD006506.pub3","Keywords":"cesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ncomparative study\r\ndigestive system\r\nflatulence\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\ngenetic heterogeneity\r\nhigh risk patient\r\nhuman\r\nintestine sound\r\nlength of stay\r\nmeta analysis\r\nnausea and vomiting\r\npostoperative complication\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nrisk assessment\r\nrisk factor\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Short V, Herbert G, Perry R, Atkinson C, Ness A R, Penfold C, Thomas S, Andersen H K, and Lewis S J (2015) Chewing gum for postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function.

This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of gum chewing and coffee and caffeine intake on ileus-related outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing noninvasive treatments for ileus after gastrointestinal surgery. The main analyses included random effects network meta-analyses using frequentist methods with simultaneous direct and indirect comparisons of time to first flatus, time to first defecation, and length of stay. Bayesian network meta-analysis using Markov chains was also used. Results: A total of 32 RCTs comparing 4999 patients were included in this network meta-analysis. Time to flatus was reduced by gum chewing (mean difference compared to control (MD): -11 h, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) − 16 to − 5 h, P < 0.001). Time to defecation was reduced by gum chewing and coffee, with MDs of -18 h (95% CI − 23 to − 13 h, P < 0.001) and -13 h (95% CI − 24 to − 1 h, P < 0.001), respectively. Length of stay was reduced by coffee and gum chewing with MDs of − 1.5 days (95% CI: − 2.5 to − 0.6 days, P < 0.001) and − 0.9 days (95% CI: − 1.3 to − 0.4 days, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Coffee and gum chewing were proven to be effective noninvasive approaches for shortening the postoperative length of hospital stay and time to first defecation, especially in open gastrointestinal surgery; thus these actions should be recommended after gastrointestinal surgery. © 2023, The Author(s).","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sinz S; Warschkow R; Tarantino I; Steffen T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sinz S, Warschkow R, Tarantino I, and Steffen T (2023) Gum Chewing and Coffee Consumption but not Caffeine Intake Improve Bowel Function after Gastrointestinal Surgery: a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.

Participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus nicotine patch alone or in combination with other medications (i.e., gum, bupropion, or nortriptyline) for smoking cessation treatment in a Brazilian Psychosocial Care Center unit (CAPS), taking into account sociodemographics and smoking profile covariates. Methods: The study involved comparison of treatment success (seven-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of the treatment) and retention (presence of the individual in all of the four medical consultations and six group sessions) in two subsamples of patients with MD (n = 267) and without MD (n = 397) who were included in a six-week treatment provided by a CAPS from 2007 to 2013. The treatment protocol comprised group CBT and pharmacotherapy (nicotine patches, nicotine gums, and bupropion and nortriptyline available, prescribed by psychiatrists). Results: Within patients with MD, CBT plus nicotine patch plus bupropion (aOR = 2.00, 95% CI [1.14, 3.50], p =.015) and CBT plus nicotine patch plus gum (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI [1.04, 4.23], p =.036) were associated with treatment success. Within patients without MD, female gender (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.37, 0.95], p =.031) and lower Heaviness of Smoking Index score (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.65, 0.99], p =.048) were associated with treatment success. No variable was associated with dropout or retention within patients with or without MD. Conclusion: Our findings support the use of CBT plus nicotine patch plus bupropion as well as CBT plus nicotine patch plus gum in samples with high rates of medical, psychiatric, and addiction disorders. These findings support those of previous studies in the general population. Pharmacological treatment associated with group CBT based on cognitive-behavioral concepts and combined with ongoing MD treatment seems to be the best option for smoking cessation treatment among patients with MD. Units that deal with patients with MD, such as CAPS in Brazil, should be encouraged to treat smoking addiction in this population. Future studies should investigate retention rates in other samples of patients with MD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Loreto Aline Rodrigues; Carvalho Carlos Felipe Cavalcanti; Frallonardo Fernanda Piotto; Ismael Flavia; Andrade Arthur Guerra de; Castaldelli-Maia João Maurício; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15504263.2017.1328149","Keywords":"Mental Disorders\r\nSmoking Cessation Evaluation\r\nCognitive Therapy Methods\r\nDrug Therapy Utilization\r\nTreatment Outcomes Evaluation\r\nNicotine Patch\r\nBupropion\r\nNortriptyline\r\nBrazil\r\nHuman\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nSample Size\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nP-Value\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nResearch Subject Retention\r\nChewing Gum\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and Over\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nAged: 65+ years\r\nAged, 80 &amp; over\r\nMale\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Loreto Aline Rodrigues, Carvalho Carlos Felipe Cavalcanti, Frallonardo Fernanda Piotto, Ismael Flavia, Andrade Arthur Guerra de, and Castaldelli-Maia João Maurício (    ) Smoking Cessation Treatment for Patients With Mental Disorders Using CBT and Combined Pharmacotherapy..

Several studies have been published investigating the use of chewing gum to reduce POI. These studies however, have produced variable results. Thus, there is currently no consensus on whether chewing gum should be widely instituted as a means to help reduce POI. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate whether the use of chewing gum post-operatively improves POI in abdominal surgery. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted according to the guidelines in the PRISMA statement. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Science Direct, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Clinical outcomes were extracted and meta-analysis was performed. Results: There were 1019 patients from 12 randomised controlled studies included in this review. Only one study was conducted in an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) environment. Seven of the twelve studies concluded that chewing gum reduced post-operative ileus. The remaining five studies found no clinical improvement. Overall, there was a small benefit in reducing time to flatus, and time to bowel motion, but no difference in the length of stay or complications. Conclusion: Chewing gum offers only a small benefit in reducing time to flatus and time to passage of bowel motion following abdominal surgery. This benefit is of limited clinical significance. Further studies should be conducted in a modern peri-operative care environment.","Comments":"2015-02-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Su'a B U; Pollock T T; Lemanu D P; MacCormick A D; Connolly A B; Hill A G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.12.032","Keywords":"abdominal surgery\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\nCinahl\r\nCochrane Library\r\ndefecation\r\nEmbase\r\nflatulence\r\nhuman\r\nlength of stay\r\nmedical literature\r\nMedline\r\nmeta analysis\r\nperioperative period\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npriority journal\r\nScienceDirect\r\nScopus\r\nsystematic review\r\nvalidity","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Su'a B U, Pollock T T, Lemanu D P, MacCormick A D, Connolly A B, and Hill A G (2015) Chewing gum and postoperative ileus in adults: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

Numerous strategies to optimise POI have been proposed but its management remains an unmet clinical need. This study aimed to characterise the duration and management of gastrointestinal recovery in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Method: A snapshot, prospective, observational study was undertaken between November 2016 and January 2017 at 10 regional hospitals in the United Kingdom. Adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with resection of bowel or reversal of stoma were included. Outcomes included time until return of gastrointestinal function, timing of nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion, uptake of targeted interventions and clinical outcomes. Data were validated for accuracy by independent investigators. Results: 204 patients met the eligibility criteria. The median time for gastrointestinal recovery was 3 days (IQR 2–4); right-sided resections were associated with longer gastrointestinal recovery than left sided (4 days (2.75–5.25) vs 3 days (2–4); P = 0.002). The rate of NGT insertion was 22.5% at a median time of 4 (4–4.75) days. NGT insertion after vomiting was associated with a higher incidence of bronchopneumonia compared to early placement (13.3% vs 29.0%). Targeted interventions, such as chewing gum (4.4%), selective mu-receptor antagonists (1.0%) and pro-kinetic agents (13.7%) were infrequently used. Conclusion: The average time to gastrointestinal recovery after elective colorectal surgery was three days. Late NGT insertion was associated with an increased incidence of bronchopneumonia. The clinical uptake of targeted interventions to improve gastrointestinal recovery was poor.","Comments":"2018-07-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tahir W; Bolton W; Pericleous A; Saeed F; Sheikh S; Silva A N; Maslekar S; Jayne D G; Altunel M; Hirst N A; Khan A; Ashmore D; Wilkins A; Wong C; Edwards C S; Nduka A; Richards E R; Mori G; Ali H; Amin I; Athanasiou C; Farooq M; Hardie C; Khan A; Khan U; O'Neill C; Sturgess G; Ebbitt G; Wells D; Sakellaropoulos S; Asmar S; Friend C; Habib S; Jarral F; Phillips M E; Suhail A; Young R S; Dykes G; Gissing S; Thomas B; Khan A; Mercer C; Wellby G; Jackson A; Singh S; Flynn L; Lloyd Jones; K; Parkash A; Simpson L J; Shields S L; Soni B H; Thethi R; Elsayeh K; Ezerska E A; Gnanapragasam S N; Williams J; Wright L N.G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/codi.13949","Keywords":"chest tube\r\nnasogastric tube\r\nmu opiate receptor antagonist\r\nprokinetic agent\r\nadult\r\nanastomosis leakage\r\narticle\r\nbronchopneumonia\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\ngastrointestinal recovery\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\nheart arrhythmia\r\nhuman\r\nintestine resection\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmulticenter study\r\nobservational study\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nstoma\r\nsurgical infection\r\ntime to treatment\r\ntreatment duration\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tahir W, Bolton W, Pericleous A, Saeed F, Sheikh S, Silva A N, Maslekar S, Jayne D G, Altunel M, Hirst N A, Khan A, Ashmore D, Wilkins A, Wong C, Edwards C S, Nduka A, Richards E R, Mori G, Ali H, Amin I, Athanasiou C, Farooq M, Hardie C, Khan A, Khan U, O'Neill C, Sturgess G, Ebbitt G, Wells D, Sakellaropoulos S, Asmar S, Friend C, Habib S, Jarral F, Phillips M E, Suhail A, Young R S, Dykes G, Gissing S, Thomas B, Khan A, Mercer C, Wellby G, Jackson A, Singh S, Flynn L, Lloyd Jones, K, Parkash A, Simpson L J, Shields S L, Soni B H, Thethi R, Elsayeh K, Ezerska E A, Gnanapragasam S N, Williams J, and Wright L N.G (2018) Multicentre observational study of gastrointestinal recovery after elective colorectal surgery.

Given that alternative modes may evoke improved physical performance via distinct mechanisms, effects may not be comparable and studies directly comparing the erogenicity of alternative modes of caffeine administration are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, the present study evaluated the effect of 3 mg·kg-1 caffeine delivered in anhydrous form via capsule ingestion, chewing gum or mouth rinsing on measures of muscular strength, power, and strength endurance in male Rugby Union players. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants completed the study (Mean ± SD: Age 20 ± 2 yrs; daily caffeine consumption 188 ± 88 mg). Following assessments and reassessment of chest press (CP), shoulder press (SP), Deadlift (DL), and Squat (SQ) 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and familiarization to the experimental procedures, participants completed six experimental trials where they were administered 3 mg.kg-1 caffeine (Caff) or placebo (Plac) capsule(CAP), chewing gum(GUM) or mouth rinse(RINSE) in a randomized, double-blind and counterbalanced fashion prior to force platform assessment of countermovement jump, drop jump and isometric mid-thigh pull performance. Strength endurance was measured across two sets of CP, SP, DL, and SQ at 70% 1RM until failure. Pre-exercise perceptions of motivation and arousal were also determined. RESULTS: Caffeine increased perceived readiness to invest mental effort (p = .038; ηp2=.156), countermovement jump height (p = .035; ηp2=.160) and SQ repetitions until failure in the first set (p < .001; d = .481), but there was no effect of delivery mode (p > .687; ηp2<.015). Readiness to invest physical effort, felt arousal, drop jump height, countermovement jump, drop jump and isometric mid-thigh pull ground reaction force-time characteristics and repetitions until failure in CP, SP and DL were not affected by caffeine administration or mode of caffeine delivery (p > .0.052; ηp2< .136). CONCLUSION: 3 mg.kg-1 caffeine administered via capsule, gum or mouth rinse had limited effects on muscular strength, power, and strength endurance. Small effects of caffeine on CMJ height could not be explained by changes in specific ground reaction force-time characteristics and were not transferable to DJ performance, and effects specific to the SQ RTP exercise underpin the complexity in understanding effects of caffeine on muscular function. Novel modes of caffeine administration proposed to evoke benefits via distinct mechanisms did not offer unique effects, and the small number of effects demonstrated may have little translation to a single performance trial when data examining direct comparison of each caffeine vehicle compared against a mode matched placebo is considered.","Comments":"2024-10-29","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tallis J; Duncan M J; Clarke N D; Morris R O; Tamilio R A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15502783.2024.2419385","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nmouthwash\r\nperformance enhancing substance\r\nathletic performance\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug effect\r\nendurance\r\nfootball\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmicrocapsule\r\nmuscle strength\r\nphysiology\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tallis J, Duncan M J, Clarke N D, Morris R O, and Tamilio R A (2024) Are caffeine effects equivalent between different modes of administration: the acute effects of 3 mg.kg-1 caffeine on the muscular strength and power of male university Rugby Union players.

Several different procedures have been used to manage bowel function, including adequate pain control, prokinetic drugs and supportive strategies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of chewing gum on bowel recovery in patients undergoing gynaecologic abdominal surgeries. A total of 137 patients were randomised into gum-chewing and control groups. Patients in the gum-chewing group began chewing gum at post-operative 3rd h and chewed gum thereafter every 4 h daily, for 30 min each time. All patients received the same post-operative treatment. Primary outcome measures were the time to first passage of flatus and time to first passage of stool. The secondary outcome measures included the first hearing of normal bowel sounds, nausea and the time until discharge from the hospital. Compared with the control group, the time interval between operation and first flatus was shorter in the gum-chewing group (median, 33 h vs 30 h). However, the difference was not significant (p = 0.381). The first defaecation time was significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group. The median time to first defaecation was 67 (20-105) h in the control group and 45 (12-97) h in the gum-chewing group (p < 0.01). Gum chewing is safe, well tolerated and it allows early defaecation after gynaecologic abdominal surgery. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tazegül Pekin; A; Kerimoʇlu O S; Doʇan N U; Ylmaz S A; Kebapclar A G; Gençoʇlu Bakbak; B B; Çelik C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tazegül Pekin, A, Kerimoʇlu O S, Doʇan N U, Ylmaz S A, Kebapclar A G, Gençoʇlu Bakbak, B B, and Çelik C (2015) Gum chewing reduces the time to first defaecation after pelvic surgery: A randomised controlled study.

Caffeine in other delivery methods, such as chewing gums, orally dissolvable strips, gels, mouthwashes, energy drinks, and nasal sprays, is believed to be absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. Inter-individual responses to caffeine's enhancing effects are recognized. The present study examined the inter-individual responses to the acute effects of encapsulated caffeine and caffeinated chewing gum on the lower-body isokinetic and isometric strength and power in strength-trained males. METHOD: A randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 15 strength-trained males (age: 25 ± 4 years, height: 176 ± 7 cm, weight: 75 ± 11 kg, habitual caffeine intake: 66 ± 15 mg·day-1). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: i) caffeinated chewing gum (CG), ii) caffeine capsule (CC), and iii) starch capsule as a placebo (PLA). Participants consumed approximately 3 to 4.5 mg·kg-1 of caffeine 60 minutes before testing. The washout period between conditions was one week. Participants performed the Sargent jump test, followed by a 5-minute active recovery (walking). Subsequently, isokinetic strength and power (60°/s and 180°/s) and isometric strength (45° and 60°) parameters were measured for knee extensor and flexor muscles. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests, with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Responders to the caffeine conditions were identified using the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) analysis. RESULTS: In knee extensors, 1) average peak torque and power at 60°/s were higher in CC (p = 0.045; + 11.2% and p = 0.038; + 14.1%) and CG (p = 0.044; + 7.3% and p = 0.015; + 11.4%) compared to PLA with a co-response rate of 60% and 66%, 2) maximum voluntary isometric contraction at 45° (MVIC-45°) was higher in CC compared to PLA (p = 0.031; + 10.1%), and 3) MVIC-60° was higher in CG compared to PLA (p = 0.037; + 10.1%) with a co-response rate of 60%. In knee flexors, 1) time to peak torque at 60°/s was higher in CG compared to PLA (p = 0.011; + 18.2%) with a co-response rate of 46%, 2) average rate of force development at 60°/s was higher in CC (p = 0.007; + 24.1%) and CG (p = 0.050; + 20.6%) compared to PLA with a co-response rate of 53%, and 3) average power at 180°/s was higher in CC compared to PLA (p = 0.033; + 18%) with a co-response rate of 46%. However, there were no differences between other strength indicators in the knee extensors and flexors between the different conditions. Vertical jump height (VJH) was higher in CC (p = 0.001; + 5.5%) and CG (p = 0.001; + 6.) compared to PLA, with a co-response rate of 53%. CONCLUSION: Caffeine supplementation in CC and CG forms significantly enhanced lower-body strength, power, and vertical jump height in strength-trained males, with over ~50% of participants exceeding the SWC thresholds across key performance metrics. CC showed slightly higher responder rates for strength parameters, while CG excelled in time-dependent measures, supporting their use as effective and flexible ergogenic aids.","Comments":"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Aesha\"=>\"Included\"}","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Teimouri-Korani H; Hemmatinafar M; Willems M E; Rezaei R; Imanian B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15502783.2025.2495228","Keywords":"caffeine\r\nperformance enhancing substance\r\nadult\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug effect\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmuscle isometric contraction\r\nmuscle strength\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nresistance training\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Teimouri-Korani H, Hemmatinafar M, Willems M E, Rezaei R, and Imanian B (2025) Individual responses to encapsulated caffeine and caffeine chewing gum on strength and power in strength-trained males.

Postoperative ileus (POI), Cesarean section (CS), is the most critical form of intestinal dysfunction that leads to absolute constipation and oral intake intolerance. It is mainly a result of a non-mechanical injury that disturbs the normal gastrointestinal tract motor activity. Objective: To assess which is more effective sugarless chewing gum or peppermint on first bowel movement after cesarean section. Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled study was conducted at Ain shams University Maternity Hospital in the period between (June to August 2021). The study included 300 full-term pregnant ladies after elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, aged 20-40, BMI ≤30and Hb ≥10. The patients had been randomly allocated to two groups: Group A received 200 ml of warm water with 2 packets of peppermint without sugar 2 hours after the surgery. Group B chewed sugarless chewing gum for 15 minutes 2 hours after the surgery. Results: Statistical analysis of current results showed that time to regain of GIT motility (4.4 ± 1.5 versus 2.8 ± 0.9 hours) and passage of flatus (8.3 ± 2.0 versus 7.1 ± 1.8 hours) were significantly longer among peppermint than gum group. Conclusion: Both peppermint and sugarless gum are effective nonpharmacological options for enhancement of post-cesarean section motility. The gum was more effective in shortening of time to regain GIT motility and passage of flatus with higher women’s acceptance. No side effects were noted except slight heartburn, nausea, and vomiting with peppermint of no significant importance. © 2021, Ain Shams University Faculty of Medicine.

According to American statistics, colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both males and females, as well as the second leading cause when combining both numbers .\n\nObjective: The current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of chewing gum in reducing postoperative ileus in patients with cancer after colorectal surgeries and evaluate the length of hospital stay (LOS) after colorectal resection, complications, and costs.\n\nMethods: One-hundred twenty-nine patients who underwent colorectal surgeries at a specialized cancer center in Jordan from April 2019 to May 2020 were recruited. After colorectal surgeries, patients were randomized into two groups. The control group (69 patients) received conventional postoperative care; the experimental group (60 patients) was asked to chew free sugar gum over one hour in the morning, noon, and evening until the first flatus.\n\nResult: The passage of the first flatus was significantly shorter in the experimental group (mean 48.02 h) than in the control group (116.45); p = .001. Also, there was a significant difference between both groups according to gender and age.\n\nConclusion: Chewing free sugar gum after colorectal surgeries can significantly improve the recovery of bowel motion by accelerating the time to first auscultation to bowel sounds, the first passage of flatus, and reduction in the LOS, which went in agreement with many studies. However, chewing gum is considered a safe, cheap, and practical method to reduce ileus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Al-kharabsheh Mohammad; Alwahedi Huda; Elhamshary Jaber; Younis Lina; Al Masri Mahmoud; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/23779608231170725","Keywords":"Chewing Gum Therapeutic Use\r\nDefecation Drug Effects\r\nColorectal Neoplasms Surgery\r\nIntestinal Obstruction Prevention and Control\r\nPostoperative Complications\r\nLength of Stay Evaluation\r\nHealth Care Costs\r\nTreatment Outcomes Evaluation\r\nHuman\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nData Analysis Software\r\nOne-Way Analysis of Variance\r\nT-Tests\r\nComparative Studies\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nRandom Assignment\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nMale\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Al-kharabsheh Mohammad, Alwahedi Huda, Elhamshary Jaber, Younis Lina, and Al Masri Mahmoud (    ) The Effect of Chewing Sugar-Free Gum to Improve Bowel Movement After Colorectal Surgeries in Patients With Colorectal Cancer..

Participants: A total of 240 females divided into 8 groups of 30 subjects each were included within the scope of the sample. Methods: The women who underwent cesarean birth were divided into eight groups by using 2<sup>3</sup> factorial test levels, depending on the use of three different methods of gum chewing, early oral hydration, and early mobilization. No intervention was applied to the women in the control group. For the other seven groups, the intestinal sounds were checked every 30 minutes with a stethoscope over the abdomen and the first time of passing gas and the first evacuation time were recorded by asking the mother. The data were evaluated with numbers, mean, and percentage calculations, Student's t test, one-way variance analysis, correlation, and Tukey HSD test. Results: The intestinal sounds were heard earlier, gas was passed earlier, and bowel movements were earlier in the first group that received all interventions compared to the other groups (p &lt; .05). The patient could not be discharged before 48 hours had passed after the cesarean birth according to the hospital protocol and the time of discharge was therefore not affected by interventions. Linking Evidence to Action: All of the three different interventions, such as gum chewing, early oral hydration, and early mobilization after cesarean birth, increase intestinal motility. The interventions are recommended during postoperative routine care to shorten hospital stay and prevent postoperative ileus.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sahin Ebru; Terzioglu Fusun; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/wvn.12125","Keywords":"Chewing Gum\r\nCesarean Section\r\nGastrointestinal Motility\r\nEarly Ambulation\r\nFluid Therapy\r\nHuman\r\nFlatulence\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nFemale\r\nAdult\r\nAuscultation\r\nT-Tests\r\nOne-Way Analysis of Variance\r\nPost Hoc Analysis\r\nTime Factors\r\nHospitals\r\nFactorial Design\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nCorrelation Coefficient\r\nPatient Discharge\r\nPerinatal Nursing\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sahin Ebru, and Terzioglu Fusun (    ) The Effect of Gum Chewing, Early Oral Hydration, and Early Mobilization on Intestinal Motility After Cesarean Birth..

To investigate the effects of chewing gum and tablet candy to reduce eyestrain in healthy individuals. Materials and Methods. A double-blinded crossover trial was conducted. Forty-six healthy individuals (23 men, 23 women) between 20 and 59 years old, feeling eyestrain, were enrolled. Each 10-year age group included 12 individuals except the 30s group, which included 10 individuals. A visual task was performed on reading material displayed on a computer screen at a fixed distance for 60 min. Gum or tablet candy of two pieces were chewed for two 15-min periods starting 15 and 45 min after starting to read. Subjects chewed gum on Day 1 and tablet candy on Day 2, and vice versa. Primary outcome is as follows: subjective eye fatigue (eye tiredness, eye heaviness, blurred vision, double vision, and eye dryness) using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes are as follows: subjective accommodation from near and far points of accommodation measured with a D'ACOMO, spherical equivalent refraction, and eye dryness by analyzing ring break-up time (RBUT) measured with the RT-7000 Auto Ref-Topographer. Results. The VAS scores of subjective eye fatigue were not significantly changed between chewing gum and tablet candy (P = 0.397 - P = 0.909). Those scores of eye tiredness and eye heaviness were significantly longer before and after the visual task with tablet candy (P = 0.013 and P = 0.025 , respectively) but not with chewing gum. The changes of subjective accommodation were significantly lower after the visual task between chewing gum and candy (P = 0.043). There were significant differences among each age group (20 s vs. 30 s, P = 0.594 ; 20 s vs. 40 s, P = 0.002 ; 20 s vs. 50 s, P = 0.002). After reading, the changes of spherical equivalent refraction did not indicate a shift toward myopia (P = 0.267). In the RBUT, there were no significant differences between the samples (P = 0.680). Conclusions. Chewing gum helps improve the ability of the eye to focus, especially in young adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Asakawa Ken; Kanno Susumu; Ando Tomonori; Osawa Kenji; Ishikawa Hitoshi; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1155/2020/2470473","Keywords":"Chewing Gum Therapeutic Use\r\nEye Pain Drug Therapy\r\nCandy Therapeutic Use\r\nHuman\r\nClinical Trials\r\nDouble-Blind Studies\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nAdult\r\nMiddle Age\r\nVisual Analog Scaling\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nAdult: 19-44 years\r\nMiddle Aged: 45-64 years\r\nMale\r\nFemale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Asakawa Ken, Kanno Susumu, Ando Tomonori, Osawa Kenji, and Ishikawa Hitoshi (    ) The Effects of Chewing Gum in Preventing Eyestrain..

Various alternate forms of caffeine administration are available, which may produce different effects. This investigation compares the effects of different forms of caffeine supplementation on 5-km running performance, and the relationship between athlete ability and degree of enhancement attained. Methods: Fourteen amateur runners completed a series of self-paced outdoor time trials following unknown ingestion of a placebo (P) or one of 3 alternate forms of caffeine supplement. Trials were randomized in a crossover design with caffeine (approximately 3–4.5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) administered 15 minutes before each trial via chewing gum (CG), dissolvable mouth strips (CS), or tablet (CT). Results: Compared with P, all caffeine supplements led to worthwhile enhancements in running performance with a mean (±95% confidence limit) overall effect across all supplements of 1.4% ± 0.9%. Individual caffeine treatment effects (CG = 0.9% ± 1.4%, CS = 1.2% ± 1.0%, and CT = 2.0% ± 1.1%) were not significantly different (P &gt;.05) from each other; however, CT trials produced the largest gain and was significantly different (P =.02) compared with P. There was no significant difference in heart rate or rate of perceived exertion across the performance trials. The magnitude of caffeine enhancement was also strongly correlated (r =.87) with no-treatment performance time. Conclusions: The findings showed that irrespective of delivery form, moderate dose of caffeine supplementation produces worthwhile gains in 5-km running performance compared with a P. Furthermore, the magnitude of caffeine enhancement is highly individualized, but it appears related to athlete performance ability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whalley Peter J; Dearing Chey G; Paton Carl D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/ijspp.2019-0287","Keywords":"Caffeine Pharmacodynamics\r\nDietary Supplementation\r\nDosage Forms\r\nRunning, Distance\r\nAthletic Performance\r\nTreatment Outcomes\r\nHuman\r\nAthletes, Amateur\r\nRunning\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nRandom Assignment\r\nCrossover Design\r\nCaffeine Administration and Dosage\r\nDescriptive Statistics\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nChewing Gum\r\nTablets","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whalley Peter J, Dearing Chey G, and Paton Carl D (    ) The Effects of Different Forms of Caffeine Supplement on 5-km Running Performance..

Methods: Women who underwent cesarean section (N = 120) were randomly allocated into Group A (xylitol gum), Group B (nonxylitol gum), or the control group (no chewing gum). Every 2 hr post-cesarean section and until first flatus, Groups A and B received two pellets of chewing gum and were asked to chew for 15 min. The times to first bowel sounds, first flatus, and first defecation were then compared among the three groups. Results: Group A had the shortest mean time to first bowel sounds (6.9 ± 1.7 hr), followed by Group B (8 ± 1.6 hr) and the control group (12.8 ±2.5 hr; one-way analysis of variance, p &lt;.001; Scheffe's post hoc comparisons, p &lt; .05).

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chewing gum on postoperative abdominal pain, nausea, and hospital stays after posterior spinal fusions (PSFs) in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Summary of Background Data: Chewing gum had been extensively reported to improve bowel motility and is recommended to hasten bowel recovery following gastrointestinal surgery. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding the effect of chewing gum on postoperative abdominal pain, nausea, and hospital stays after PSFs in AIS patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed for relevant randomized controlled trials using PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Embase. Studies were selected to compare the use of chewing gum versus standard care in the management of postoperative abdominal pain and nausea in AIS patients undergoing PSFs. Hospital stays were also investigated. The study was conducted using the checklist for PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Results: Three randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis. No significant effect of chewing gum was highlighted concerning the postoperative abdominal pain scores at 24 and 48 hours [24 h: mean difference (MD)=0.45, 95% CI=-0.97 to 0.07, P=0.09; 48 h: MD=-0.24, 95% CI=-0.79 to 0.32, P=0.41]. No significant difference regarding the postoperative nausea scores was found at 24 and 48 hours (24 h: MD=0.26, 95% CI=-0.27 to 0.79, P=0.34; 48 h: MD=0.06, 95% CI=-0.36 to 0.48, P=0.77). No significant difference regarding hospital stays was found (MD=0.13, 95% CI=-0.02 to 0.28, P=0.09). Conclusions: Based on the current studies, chewing gum does not have a significant effect on postoperative abdominal pain, nausea, or hospital stays after PSFs in AIS patients. As the effect of chewing gum in reducing postoperative abdominal pain exhibits a tendency towards statistical significance (P=0.09), the effect of chewing gum in spinal surgery merits further studies with larger sample size.","Comments":"2023-12-18","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tong B; Chen Z; Li G; Zhang L; Chen Y; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/BSD.0000000000001519","Keywords":"abdominal pain\r\nadolescent idiopathic scoliosis\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ngastrointestinal surgery\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nintestine motility\r\nmeta analysis\r\nposterior spine fusion\r\npostoperative nausea\r\npostoperative pain\r\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrisk assessment\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tong B, Chen Z, Li G, Zhang L, and Chen Y (2023) Chewing Gum Cannot Reduce Postoperative Abdominal Pain and Nausea After Posterior Spinal Fusions in Patients With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Fourteen national-level (age: 25.2 ± 5.4; height: 176.5 ± 5.3; weight: 78.1 ± 13.4) ice hockey players were tested late at night after a full day awake schedule with jet lag. A randomised, double-blind experimental design was employed in which participants either chewed caffeinated gum (CAF) containing 3 mg/kg caffeine or a caffeine-free placebo gum (PLA) for 10 min prior to undertaking a series of on-ice and off-ice tests. The off-ice tests included grip force, the counter-movement jump (CMJ), and the squat jump (SJ). The on-ice tests included a 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1 test). The CMJ height (CAF: 47.2 ± 4.4; PL: 45.9 ± 3.5; p = 0.035; Cohen’s d = 0.32) and SJ height (CAF: 46.7 ± 4.1; PL: 44.9 ± 3.8; p = 0.047; Cohen’s d = 0.44) were found to be significantly higher in the CAF than in the PL trial. However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in grip force, as well as in the 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo IR1 test. The present study found that, following a jet lag intervention, although the consumption of caffeinated gum resulted in an increase in vertical jump height, it had no impact on performance in the ice tests. The results of this study may help coaches and athletes consider the need for caffeine supplementation when experiencing jet lag.","Comments":"2024-10-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tsai M T; Shiu Y J; Ho C C; Chen C H; Chiu C H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/nu16183151","Keywords":"NCT06557655\r\ncaffeine\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\nagility\r\narticle\r\nathletic performance\r\ncaffeinated chewing gum\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncounter movement jump\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nelite athlete\r\nexperimental design\r\ngrip force\r\ngrip strength\r\nheight\r\nhockey player\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nice hockey\r\njet lag\r\njumping\r\nmale\r\nmovement (physiology)\r\nnormal human\r\nphysical performance\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsleep time\r\nsquat jump\r\nsquatting (position)\r\nwakefulness\r\nwarm up","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tsai M T, Shiu Y J, Ho C C, Chen C H, and Chiu C H (2024) Effects of Caffeinated Chewing Gum on Ice Hockey Performance after Jet Lag Intervention: Double-Blind Crossover Trial.

Patients were randomised into two groups (n = 58, study; n = 51, control). In the study group, patients started chewing sugarless gum every 2 h for 15 min, beginning at the second postoperative hour. The control group did not chew gum, and they received standard postoperative care. Both groups were compared primarily in terms of the amount of time until the first bowel movement, the time of the first passage of flatus and the time of first defaecation. The amount of time until the first bowel movement, the time of the first passage of flatus and the time of the first defaecation were found to be significantly shorter in the chewing gum group (p <.001). The amount of postoperative analgesics that were needed and VAS scores at 6-hours and 24-hours postoperatively, were found to be lower in the study group than in the control group (p <.001). Chewing gum was found to have beneficial effects on bowel motility and postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. This affordable and simple method could be recommended to patients after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction remains a source of morbidity and the major determinant of length of stay after abdominal operation. The mechanism of enhanced recovery from postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction with the help of chewing gum is believed to be the cephalic-vagal stimulation of digestion which increases the promotability of neural and humoral factors that act on different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. What do the results of this study add? The findings of previous randomised controlled studies have been inconsistent regarding the effect of chewing gum on postoperative bowel function following abdominal gynecological surgery. In this randomised prospective study, we found that chewing gum early in the postoperative period after total laparoscopic hysterectomy hastened time to bowel motility and flatus. To our knowledge this is the first study of the impact of chewing gum on bowel motility after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Chewing gum early in the postoperative period following laparoscopic hysterectomy hastens time to bowel motility and flatus. The use of chewing gum is a simple and cheap strategy for promoting the recovery of gastrointestinal functions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Turkay Ü; Yavuz A; Hortu İ; Terzi H; Kale A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Turkay Ü, Yavuz A, Hortu İ, Terzi H, and Kale A (2020) The impact of chewing gum on postoperative bowel activity and postoperative pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

We conducted this systematic review to evaluate the effects of postoperative gum chewing on the recovery of gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, Embase, and a reference list of relevant studies from the inception to 11 March 2024, comparing postoperative gum chewing versus no gum chewing following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery regardless of indications and setting without language restriction. The primary outcome was the time to the presence of bowel sounds and the time to the first passage of flatus. Cochrane’s risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Results: Nine RCTs with a total of 1011 patients were included. Overall, three studies were categorized as having a low risk of bias, three had some concerns, and three exhibited a high risk of bias. The time to the presence of bowel sounds (mean difference [MD] −2.66 h, 95% confidence interval [CI] −3.68 to −1.64, p < 0.00001) and time to the first passage of flatus (MD −4.20 h, 95% CI −5.79 to −2.61, p < 0.00001) was significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group. There was no statistical difference between the two groups with regard to the time to the first defecation (MD −6.52 h, 95% CI −15.70 to 2.66, p = 0.16), time to the first postoperative mobilization (MD 24.05 min, 95% CI −38.16 to 86.26, p = 0.45), postoperative ileus (MD 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19, p = 0.17), and length of hospital stay (MD −0.05 day, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.04, p = 0.28). Conclusions: Gum chewing following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery appears to promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, as evidenced by a reduced time to the presence of bowel sounds and the first passage of flatus.","Comments":"2024-06-10","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tuscharoenporn T; Uruwankul K; Charoenkwan K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jcm13102851","Keywords":"adult\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndefecation\r\nelective surgery\r\nEmbase\r\nfemale\r\nflatulence\r\ngastrointestinal tract function\r\ngynecologic surgery\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nintestine sound\r\nlaparoscopic surgery\r\nlength of stay\r\nMedline\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmobilization\r\noperation duration\r\npostoperative ileus\r\npostoperative period\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\ntotal laparoscopic hysterectomy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tuscharoenporn T, Uruwankul K, and Charoenkwan K (2024) Effects of Postoperative Gum Chewing on Recovery of Gastrointestinal Function Following Laparoscopic Gynecologic Surgery: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Various agents have been tested in the treatment of postoperative ileus but no agent alone has achieved effectiveness as postoperative ileus is of multifactorial aetiology. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of combined use of gum-chewing and parenteral metoclopramide on the duration of postoperative ileus after abdominal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomised controlled study of patients aged 16-65 years who underwent elective abdominal surgeries. Patients were randomised into a gum-metoclopramide (GM) group, a gum-only (G) group, a metoclopramide-only (M) group and a control (C) group. Patients in the GM group chewed gum and received intravenous metoclopramide, each 8 hourly. In G group, patients chewed only gum, whereas those in M group received only 10mg of intravenous metoclopramide, 8 hourly. To C group, 10 mL of intravenous sterile water was given 8 hourly. Patients were monitored for time to passage of first flatus or faeces. Groups were compared for the duration of postoperative ileus and duration of hospital stay using analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at a P value of <0.05. RESULTS: Fifty-two out of the 105 recruited patients were eligible for analysis. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.9 with a median age of 57.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] =16 years). Prolonged postoperative ileus occurred in 9.4% (n = 5) of the patients (GM = 2, G = 1, M = 2, C = 0; P = 0.604) and was associated with longer duration of nasogastric tube use (P = 0.028). The duration of postoperative ileus was 3 days (IQR = 2), 2.5 days (IQR = 3.3), 4 days (IQR = 1.5) and 3 days (IQR = 2) in the GM, G, M, and C groups, respectively (P = 0.317), whereas the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR = 3), shortest in G group (6.5 days, IQR = 8) and longest in M group (9 days, IQR = 3) (P = 0.143). CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of gum-chewing and parenteral metoclopramide had no effect on the duration of postoperative ileus following abdominal surgeries in adult surgical patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ulasi IB; Afuwape OO; Ayandipo OO; Fakoya A; Irabor DO; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4103/jwas.jwas_38_23 ","Keywords":"Abdominal surgery\r\ngum-chewing\r\nileus\r\nmetoclopramide","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ulasi IB, Afuwape OO, Ayandipo OO, Fakoya A, and Irabor DO (2023) The Effects of Combined Gum-chewing and Parenteral Metoclopramide on the Duration of Postoperative Ileus After Abdominal Surgery..

Twenty-three patients with FM completed a caffeine condition where they consumed a caffeinated chewing gum that contains 100 mg of caffeine, and a placebo condition where they consumed a non-caffeinated chewing gum. They completed isometric handgrip exercise at 25% of their maximal strength for 3 min, and muscle pain rating (MPR) was recorded every 30 s during exercise. Clinical pain severity was assessed in each condition using a pain questionnaire. The order of the two conditions was randomly determined. MPR increased during exercise, but caffeinated chewing gum did not attenuate the increase in MPR compared to placebo gum. Clinical pain severity was generally associated with the average MPR and the caffeine effects on MPR, calculated as difference in the average MPR between the two conditions. The results suggest that more symptomatic individuals with FM may experience greater exercise-induced muscle pain, but benefit more from caffeinated chewing gum to reduce exercise-induced muscle pain.","Comments":"2016-03-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Umeda M; Kempka L; Weatherby A; Greenlee B; Mansion K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.02.008","Keywords":"caffeine\r\ngabapentin\r\nplacebo\r\npregabalin\r\ntramadol\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\ncardiovascular response\r\nchewing gum\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nexercise intensity\r\nfemale\r\nfibromyalgia\r\nhand grip\r\nhuman\r\nisometric exercise\r\nmuscle exercise\r\nmyalgia\r\npain intensity\r\npain severity\r\npriority journal\r\nquestionnaire\r\nstrength","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Umeda M, Kempka L, Weatherby A, Greenlee B, and Mansion K (2016) Effects of caffeinated chewing gum on muscle pain during submaximal isometric exercise in individuals with fibromyalgia.

Gum chewing may reduce POI and therefore enhance recovery after surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of gum chewing on POI, length of hospital stay and inflammatory parameters. Methods: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery in one of two centres were randomized to either chewing gum or a dermal patch (control). Chewing gum was started before surgery and stopped when oral intake was resumed. Primary endpoints were POI and length of stay. Secondary endpoints were systemic and local inflammation, and surgical complications. Gastric emptying was measured by ultrasonography. Soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A) and interleukin (IL) 8 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Between May 2009 and September 2012, 120 patients were randomized to chewing gum (58) or dermal patch (control group; 62). Mean(s.d.) length of hospital stay was shorter in the chewing gum group than in controls, but this difference was not significant: 9·5(4·9) versus 14·0(14·5) days respectively. Some 14 (27 per cent) of 52 analysed patients allocated to chewing gum developed POI compared with 29 (48 per cent) of 60 patients in the control group (P=0·020). More patients in the chewing gum group first defaecated within 4 days of surgery (85 versus 57 per cent; P=0·006) and passed first flatus within 48h (65 versus 50 per cent; P=0·044). The decrease in antral area measured by ultrasonography following a standard meal was significantly greater among patients who chewed gum: median 25 (range -36 to 54) per cent compared with 10 (range -152 to 54) per cent in controls (P=0·004). Levels of IL-8 (133 versus 288pg/ml; P=0·045) and TNFRSF1A (0·74 versus 0·92ng/ml; P=0·043) were lower among patients in the chewing gum group. Fewer patients in this group developed a grade IIIb complication (2 of 58 versus 10 of 62; P=0·031). Conclusion: Gum chewing is a safe and simple treatment to reduce POI, and is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers and complications.

Vomiting was present in two patients from group A and in eight from group B (6.25 vs. 25.0%; p = 0.03). Passage of flatus within the first 48 hours was present in 30 patients from group A and in 20 from group B (94 vs. 63%; p = 0.002). There was earlier oral feeding (96 ± 53 vs. 117 ± 65 hours; p= 0.164) and a shorter length of hospital stay (7 ± 5 vs. 9 ± 5 days; p= 0.26) in the gum-chewing group (p N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: The use of chewing gum after colorectal surgery was associated with less postoperative ileus and vomiting, and with an increased passage of flatus within the first 48 hours after surgery. Since gum chewing is an inexpensive procedure and is not associated with higher morbidity, it can be safely used for a faster postoperative recovery in elective colorectal surgery. BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus generates a high impact on morbidity, hospital stay, and costs. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficiency and safety of chewing gum to decrease postoperative ileus in colorectal surgery. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was performed including 64 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis in a tertiary referral center. Patients were divided in two groups: (i) A: gum chewing group (n = 32), and (ii) B: patients who had standard postoperative recovery (n = 32).","Comments":"2017-07-24","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vergara-Fernandez O; Gonzalez-Vargas A P; Castellanos-Juarez J C; Salgado-Nesme N; Sanchez-Garcia Ramos; E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"chewing gum\r\nadolescent\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nanastomosis\r\nchewing gum\r\ncolorectal surgery\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nileus\r\nlength of stay\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\npostoperative complication\r\npostoperative nausea and vomiting\r\nprocedures\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\ntertiary care center\r\nvery elderly\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vergara-Fernandez O, Gonzalez-Vargas A P, Castellanos-Juarez J C, Salgado-Nesme N, Sanchez-Garcia Ramos, and E (2016) Usefulness of Gum Chewing to Decrease Postoperative Ileus in Colorectal Surgery with Primary Anastomosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

This study was conducted to assess if chewing a sugar-free gum for 20 min following a meal, as recommended for dental caries prevention, influences the postprandial blood glucose levels in a period of one hour. Materials and Methods: For each of 18 participants blood glucose profile was made by measuring capillary glucose concentration in 10-min intervals within one hour following: a) chewing a sugar-free gum, b) the consumption of an oatmeal, c) chewing a sugar-free gum after the consumption of an oatmeal. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the glycaemic response following complex carbohydrate ingestion when a gum was chewed after a meal. Conclusions: The possible influence of gum chewing on the postprandial gastrointestinal and metabolic ongoings was not reflected in the postprandial glycaemic response under the conditions of this study. A more comprehensive study which would include more variables related to vagal efferent activity, digestion and metabolism would be needed to assess if chewing sugar-free gums to exploit their caries-protective potential can influence metabolic adaptability to nutritional challenges.","Comments":"2018-01-19","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vuletic L; Klaic M; Spalj S; Peros K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1515/rjdnmd-2017-0017","Keywords":"blood glucose meter\r\nContour Next test strips\r\nContour XT glucometers\r\nglucose\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbody mass\r\ncarbohydrate metabolism\r\ncaries prevention\r\nchewing gum\r\ncomparative study\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncorrelation coefficient\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndental caries\r\ndigestion\r\nfemale\r\nfood intake\r\nglucose blood level\r\nglucose metabolism\r\nglycemic control\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nmale\r\nmetabolism\r\nnormal human\r\noatmeal\r\nobservational study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsalivation\r\nsugar free chewing gum\r\ntest meal\r\nContour Next test strips\r\nContour XT glucometers","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vuletic L, Klaic M, Spalj S, and Peros K (2017) The effect of chewing a sugar-free gum after oatmeal on the postprandial glycaemia - A cross-over study.

Summary of Background Data: Appetite loss is a common problem after major abdominal surgery. Understanding of etiology and treatment options is limited. Methods: We searched Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for studies describing postoperative appetite loss. Data were extracted to clarify definition, etiology, measurement, surgical influence, pharmacological, and nonpharmacological treatment. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42021224489. Results: Out of 6144 articles, we included 165 studies, 121 of which were also analyzed quantitatively. A total of 19.8% were randomized, controlled trials (n = 24) and 80.2% were nonrandomized studies (n = 97). The studies included 20,506 patients undergoing the following surgeries: esophageal (n = 33 studies), gastric (n = 48), small bowel (n = 6), colon (n = 27), rectal (n = 20), hepatobiliary (n = 6), and pancreatic (n = 13). Appetite was mostly measured with the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ C30, n = 54). In a meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials gum chewing reduced time to first hunger by 21.2 hours among patients who had bowel surgery. Other reported treatment options with positive effects on appetite but lower levels of evidence include, among others, intravenous ghrelin administration, the oral Japanese herbal medicine Rikkunshito, oral mosapride citrate, multidisciplin-ary-counseling, and watching cooking shows. No studies investigated the effect of well-known appetite stimulants such as cannabinoids, steroids, or megestrol acetate on surgical patients. Conclusions: Appetite loss after major abdominal surgery is common and associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. Recent studies demonstrate the influence of reduced gastric volume and ghrelin secretion, and increased satiety hormone secretion. There are various treatment options available including level IA evidence for postoperative gum chewing. In the future, surgical trials should include the assessment of appetite loss as a relevant outcome measure.","Comments":"2022-08-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wagner M; Probst P; Haselbeck-Köbler M; Brandenburg J M; Kalkum E; Störzinger D; Kessler J; Simon J J; Friederich H C; Angelescu M; Billeter A T; Hackert T; Müller-Stich B P; Büchler M W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/SLA.0000000000005379","Keywords":"alvimopan\r\nappetite stimulant\r\ncannabinoid\r\ncarbohydrate\r\ndronabinol\r\nghrelin\r\nmegestrol acetate\r\nmosapride\r\noctreotide\r\nrikkunshito\r\nsteroid\r\nabdominal surgery\r\nappetite\r\narticle\r\nchewing gum\r\ncolon surgery\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncounseling\r\nenhanced recovery after surgery\r\nenteric feeding\r\nesophagus surgery\r\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30\r\nfollow up\r\nfood intake\r\nhuman\r\nintestine motility\r\nintestine surgery\r\nloss of appetite\r\nmultidisciplinary team\r\npalliative therapy\r\npancreas surgery\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrectum surgery\r\nsatiety\r\nstomach surgery\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wagner M, Probst P, Haselbeck-Köbler M, Brandenburg J M, Kalkum E, Störzinger D, Kessler J, Simon J J, Friederich H C, Angelescu M, Billeter A T, Hackert T, Müller-Stich B P, and Büchler M W (2022) The Problem of Appetite Loss after Major Abdominal Surgery: A Systematic Review.

The body responds to stressful events by release of hormones, like cortisol, as well as reaction of the sympathetic nervous system. One strategy to counteract stress is chewing gum. The present study aimed at investigating the influence of mastication on biomarkers of stress during performance of a stress test. Methods: A two-armed cross-over study with 40 young male volunteers was performed. Hormone plasma concentrations were determined after an initial resting phase (2:30 p.m.), immediately before (3:00 p.m.) and two times after (3:20, 3:50 p.m.) performance of a multitasking test using magnetic beads and ELISA methods. In addition, visual analog scales were used to rate subjective mood and the breathing and heart rates were monitored throughout the entire study period using a sensor chest belt. Results: Performance of the stress test led to an increase in plasma cortisol concentrations from 223 ± 23.3 to 325 ± 38.4 ng/ml (p = 0.023) and caused changes in subjective mood ratings as well as breathing rates. Although chewing gum base had no impact on the plasma hormone concentrations, it induced a stronger elevation of average heart rates compared to not chewing (p = 0.016). Discussion: The effect of chewing gum on a mild stress load was less pronounced than in previous studies. Besides the detection of cortisol in saliva, not in plasma, in previous studies, flavored gum was used. Aroma active compounds might have substantially contributed to the beneficial effects of gum on biomarker of stress shown before.","Comments":"2015-11-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walker J; Hosiner A; Kergoat S; Walker J M; Somoza V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.11.003","Keywords":"beta endorphin\r\ncorticotropin\r\nhydrocortisone\r\norexin A\r\noxytocin\r\nsubstance P\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbreathing rate\r\nchewing gum\r\ncognition\r\nenzyme linked immunosorbent assay\r\nflavor\r\nheart rate\r\nhormone blood level\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nmental stress\r\nmood\r\nnormal human\r\npriority journal\r\nsympathetic tone\r\ntask performance\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walker J, Hosiner A, Kergoat S, Walker J M, and Somoza V (2016) Chewing unflavored gum does not reduce cortisol levels during a cognitive task but increases the response of the sympathetic nervous system.

Although it was reported that some pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures can reduce POST, because of limitations and variable success rates, we need to find a simpler and more effective way to alleviate POST. METHODS: This prospective, observer-blinded, randomized controlled study enrolled 140 patients who required general anesthesia administered via a streamlined liner of the pharyngeal airway (SLIPA) for <60 minutes. They were randomly divided into the gum (group G, n = 70) and control (group C, n = 70) groups. Before the induction of general anesthesia for 5-10 minutes, the patients in group G chewed gum for 2 minutes. Group C was asked to swallow twice without any additional treatment. A standard anesthesia protocol was followed. The incidence and severity of sore throat were assessed up to 24 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was the incidence of POST numerical rating scale (NRS) scores >3 within 24 hours after surgery, and the secondary outcomes included the POST (NRS) scores 2, 6, and 24 hours after the surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of moderate/severe POST (NRS >3) within 24 hours after surgery was significantly lower in group G (10.1%, 7/69) than in group C (40.6%, 28/69) (odds ratio 0.386, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.153-0.976; P =.044). The median (interquartile range [range]) scores at 2, 6, and 24 hours after anesthesia in group G were lower than those in the control group at the same times (2 hours: 0 [0-3 {0-4}] vs 3 [0-3 {0-6}], P =.048; 6 hours: 0 [0-3 {0-6}] vs 2 [0-4 {0-6}], P =.048; 24 hours: 0 [0-1 {0-7}] vs 0 [0-2 {0-6}]; P =.011). There were 14 patients (20.3%, 14/69) in group G who had blood stains on the SGA device, which was significantly lower than the number in group C (37.7%, 26/69) (P =.024). In patients with bloody SGA devices, the incidence of POST scores >3 was significantly lower in group G (14.3%, 2/14) than in group C (73.1%, 19/26) (P <.001), while there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of POST score >3 in patients without bloody SGA devices (group G: 9.1%, 5/55; group C: 20.9%, 9/43; P =.145). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum before surgery can effectively reduce POST with a SGA device for hysteroscopic surgery, especially in patients with pharyngeal mucosal injury.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang T; Wang Q; Zhou H; Huang S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1213/ANE.0000000000004664","Keywords":"adult\r\narticle\r\nblood stain\r\nchewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfemale\r\ngeneral anesthesia\r\nhuman\r\nincidence\r\ninjury\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nnumeric rating scale\r\noutcome assessment\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\nsore throat\r\nsupraglottic airway device\r\nsurgery","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang T, Wang Q, Zhou H, and Huang S (2020) Effects of Preoperative Gum Chewing on Sore Throat After General Anesthesia With a Supraglottic Airway Device: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

As drug therapies are not feasible, non-pharmacological strategies are needed to reduce thirst and thirst-related burden. Objectives: To identify non-pharmacological interventions aiming to reduce thirst in patients with CHF and/ or HD, to describe intervention components, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Methods: In February 2024, we completed a systematic search in MEDLINE via PubMed, Livivo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, performed critical appraisal and data extraction. We checked risk of bias with the checklists of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and calculated meta-analyses for sufficiently homogeneous studies using fixed-effects models. Results: We included 15 intervention studies applying non-pharmacological interventions including chewing gum (n = 8), low-sodium diet (n = 2), acupressure (n = 1), frozen strawberries (n = 1), fluid timetables (n = 1), ice cubes and mouthwash (n = 1), and a psychological intervention (n = 1). Sample sizes varied between 11 and 88 participants. Eleven intervention studies showed a reduction of thirst as intervention effect. Meta-analyses for chewing gum showed no significant effect on thirst using a visual analogue scale (IV: -2,32 [-10.37,5.73]; p = 0.57) or the dialysis thirst inventory (IV: -0.26 [- 1.83, 1.30]; p = 0.74). Quality of studies was moderate to low.

Methods: We performed a comprehensive, systematic meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of gum chewing after caesarean section. Studies were identified by searching EMBASE et al database (until June 30, 2016). Summary odd ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome with fixed- or random-effects model. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1659 women were included in our meta-analysis. Gum chewing provided significant benefits in reducing the time to first passage of flatus, first defecation, first bowel sound, first bowel movement and the length of hospital stay, but not in the time to first feeling of hunger. Conclusions: Gun chewing hastens the intestinal function recovery after caesarean section and offers a safe and inexpensive option. High-quality and larger-scale RCTs are still warranted to clarify the role of gum chewing in intestinal function recovery after caesarean section.","Comments":"2017-05-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wen Z; Shen M; Wu C; Ding J; Mei B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12884-017-1286-8","Keywords":"article\r\ncesarean section\r\nchewing gum\r\ndefecation\r\nflatulence\r\nhuman\r\nhunger\r\nintestine function\r\nintestine motility\r\nintestine sound\r\nlength of stay\r\nmastication\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wen Z, Shen M, Wu C, Ding J, and Mei B (2017) Chewing gum for intestinal function recovery after caesarean section: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Sixty volunteers (mean age 23.3±3.01 years) without general or neuropsychiatric disease were recruited, and Stroop tests and stress surveys were conducted. Volunteers were administered performed a General and Emotional Stroop test with and without chewing gum, and the response time was recorded. The response time after chewing gum was significantly faster while conducting the General Stroop test. Stimulation of chewing gum may increase blood flow to the brain, which results in increased cognitive function. The response time was longer in the incongruent stimuli test compared to the congruent stimuli test, due to the effect of Stroop interference. However, when the chewing gum stimulus was introduced, the possibility of effectively reducing this effect. Stress index and response time of negative stimuli test showed weak positive correlation.

Our intention was to explore the neural mechanisms regulating the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1). After fasting for 12 h, 12 healthy male, non-obese volunteers (18 < BMI < 30), were asked to chew sugarless gum at a frequency of 80 times every 2 min for a total of 30 min. Blood samples were collected before the start of chewing and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after the start of chewing. Satiety and hunger were evaluated on a scale from 0 to 100 at each time point. Compared with the control group, the test group’s satiety was increased at 15, 25, and 30 min (p = 0.043, p = 0.014 and p = 0.018, respectively) after they began chewing sugarless gum 80 times every 2 min. The blood GLP-1 level of the test group at 30 min was 49.6 ± 20.3 pmol/l, significantly higher than that of the control group (38.9 ± 20.9 pmol/l; p = 0.031). There was no significant difference in the test group’s GLP-1 concentration at each time point. In the control group, compared to baseline, the GLP-1 concentrations at 15, 25, and 30 min were significantly decreased (p = 0.042, p = 0.0214 and p = 0.012, respectively). No significant differences in the blood concentration of glucose, insulin and GIP or hunger were observed between groups.

The impact of fennel tea and chewing gum on bowel motility remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of chewing gum and fennel tea on intestinal motility after cesarean section. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted between January 2018 and April 2018 with 120 participants divided into four groups: chewing gum, fennel tea, chewing gum plus fennel tea, and control (n = 30 per group). Bowel sounds, time to first flatulence, and defecation were recorded. Data were analyzed using statistical tests with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: The chewing gum plus fennel tea group exhibited the earliest onset of bowel sounds (6.96 ± 3.41 hours). The fennel tea group demonstrated the shortest time to first flatulence (15.47 ± 7.77 hours) and first defecation (21.02 ± 8.75 hours) compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Although chewing gum alone promoted enhanced bowel motility, it was less effective than fennel tea alone. No complications or adverse events were reported in any group. Conclusions: Chewing gum and fennel tea are cost-effective interventions to improve intestinal motility post-cesarean section. Incorporating these remedies into postoperative care may reduce gastrointestinal complications.

This was a single-center interventional study, and nonrandomized study with a historical control group (HCG). TECPs who underwent first-stage radical esophagectomy were recruited. Thirty-two patients of 40 in the gum-chewing group (GCG) were completed perioperative GCT in 3 times daily. Propensity score matching was performed with covariates related to TP including preoperative age, sex, body mass index, and the repetitive saliva swallowing test result, and yielded a matched cohort of 25 case pairs. Eleven GCG patients [44.0%] exhibited significantly lower TP at 2 weeks postoperatively than before esophagectomy was significantly fewer than that of 19 patients [76.0%] in the HCG. The median number of fever days (> 38 °C) in the 2 weeks after esophagectomy in the GCG was significantly fewer than those in the HCG.

Objective: The objective of the study was to study the efficacy of chewing gum in patients with rectal cancer after elective open proctectomy only. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed. We recruited patients who would undergo elective open proctectomy for rectal cancer in Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Patients in the intervention arm received chewing gum 3 times a day postoperatively. All patients in the trial were placed on the same perioperative management and standardized post-operative care plans.

Study design: One hundred fifty patients undergoing cesarean sections were randomized into a gum chewing group (n = 75) and a control group (n = 75). Patients in the gum group chewed one sugarless gum for 30 min at 3, 5, and 7 h postoperatively. The two groups were compared in terms of time to first bowel movement, first feeling of hunger, first passage of flatus, and defecation time. Postoperative satisfaction with bowel movements was rated on a scale of 1–5. Results: First bowel movement time (4.93 ± 1.05 versus 7.97 ± 2.33 h postoperatively, p =.0001), first feeling of hunger (5.51 ± 1.68 versus 6.30 ± 1.58 h postoperatively, p =.004), first passage of flatus (11.73 ± 4.61 versus 14.10 ± 2.71 h postoperatively, p =.001), and mean length of hospital stay (2.30 ± 0.49 versus 2.50 ± 0.50 d, p =.015) were significantly reduced in the gum group compared with the control group. Postoperative satisfaction scores for overall bowel function were better in the patients who chewed gum. Conclusion: Gum chewing at frequent intervals in the early postoperative period promotes the early return of bowel movements, shortens hospitalization, and increases patient satisfaction regarding bowel function. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yenigul N N; Aydogan Mathyk; B; Aslan Cetin; B; Yazici Yilmaz; F; Ayhan I; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yenigul N N, Aydogan Mathyk, B, Aslan Cetin, B, Yazici Yilmaz, F, and Ayhan I (2020) Efficacy of chewing gum for improving bowel function after cesarean sections: a randomized controlled trial.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of gum chewing on pain and anxiety during intravenous (IV) cannulation in children. Design and methods: This randomized controlled study assessed 73 children aged 6 to 12 years in the general paediatric unit in a university hospital in the Trachy Region, Turkey from April to September 2017. In the experimental group, children chewed gum during the procedure. The standard care was applied to the control group. Data were collected via the Children's Anxiety Pain Scale and the Data Collection Form. Results: According to the children's self-report and the nurse's report, the pain level of the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group. Although no significant difference was noted between experimental and control groups' anxiety levels, nurses stated higher anxiety levels than children. Conclusions: The IV cannulation procedure causes pain and anxiety in children. Nurses reported the perception of a higher level of anxiety during the procedure than the children actually experienced. Gum chewing might reduce pain during IV cannulation. Nurses should consider using gum chewing as a simple nursing implementation to increase the effects of other pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques for management of children's procedural pain. Practice implications: Nurses who work with the children could use gum chewing as a simple, inexpensive, and pleasurable intervention for the management of pain. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 January 2025","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yildizeli Topcu; S; Akgun Kostak; M; Semerci R; Guray O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yildizeli Topcu, S, Akgun Kostak, M, Semerci R, and Guray O (2020) Effect of Gum Chewing on Pain and Anxiety in Turkish Children During Intravenous Cannulation: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Considering the vicious circle between anxiety and pain, gum chewing may help to break this circle and control the pain caused by invasive procedures. This study aims to investigate whether chewing gum can help relieving pain and anxiety associated with tube thoracostomy application. A pre-test/post-test control group design was used in this quasi-experimental study, which included 46 patients who were applied tube thoracostomy. The patients were assigned to the gum-chewing group and the control group. Patients' pain and anxiety levels were assessed at the 2nd hour following the analgesic application performed after tube tho racostomy and once again 30 minutes after this assessment. The data were analyzed using percentage, frequency, mean, independent and paired samples t-tests. There was a difference between the chewing gum group and the control group in terms of changes in p ain and anxiety. In the second evaluation made after chewing gum, it was determined that the pain and anxiety levels of the gum chewing group were significantly relieved. In management of the pain and the anxiety levels resulting from tube thoracostomy, ch ewing gum may help to eliminate the vicious circle between pain and anxiety and so reduce pain and anxiety. Chewing gum, as a simple and affordable nursing intervention contributing to pain and anxiety management, should be included in care practices for r elieving pain and anxiety after thoracic invasive interventions.","Comments":"2024-08-26","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yıldızeli Topçu; S; Işıklı A G; Yanık F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5505/ejm.2024.01047","Keywords":"chest tube\r\ntube\r\nhydrocortisone\r\nlidocaine\r\nmidazolam\r\nsevoflurane\r\nadult\r\nanalgesia\r\nanalgesic activity\r\nanalytical research\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nasthma\r\nbrain blood flow\r\nbreathing exercise\r\nbronchopleural fistula\r\ncannulation\r\nchewing gum\r\nchylothorax\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndepression\r\ndorsal raphe nucleus\r\nelectroencephalogram\r\nfatigue\r\nfemale\r\nheart catheterization\r\nhematothorax\r\nhuman\r\ninvasive procedure\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmastication\r\nmasticatory muscle\r\nmiddle aged\r\nmood\r\nmusic therapy\r\nnursing intervention\r\noxygen saturation\r\npain\r\npain assessment\r\npain intensity\r\npain severity\r\nphysiological stress\r\npleura effusion\r\npleurodesis\r\npneumothorax\r\nquasi experimental study\r\nState Trait Anxiety Inventory\r\nthoracostomy\r\nthorax pain\r\nvascular access","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yıldızeli Topçu, S, Işıklı A G, and Yanık F (2024) A Contributing Approach to The Management of Pain and Anxiety Associated with Tube Thoracostomy: Chewing Gum.

Methods: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to either a gum-chewing group or a control group. Participants in the gum-chewing group were instructed to chew gum for 15 minutes every 6 hours while awake until they passed gas for the first time, while those in the control group received standard postoperative care. The primary outcome measure was the time to the first passage of flatus, and secondary outcome measures included the time to first bowel movement sounds, time to first defecation, and length of hospital stay. Results: The study included 100 patients who were randomly assigned to either the gum-chewing group (n=52) or the routine care group (n=48). Patients in the gum-chewing group had a significantly shorter time to the passage of the first flatus compared to those in the control group (20.7±13.1 vs. 26.8±15.8 h; P<0.05).

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2022 in English and Chinese, using the EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane database), PubMed, Medline (via Ovid), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wan Fang databases. A total of 837 studies were screened using Endnote software, and those that met the inclusion criteria were selected for analysis. The main outcome of interest was the incidence of postoperative ileus, and secondary outcomes included time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, and length of hospital stay. Results: Two authors extracted data and performed quality assessment independently. The review included six RCTs with a total of 669 patients. Compared with routine care, gum-chewing could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.72, P=0.0006), shorten the time to first flatus (WMD -9.58, 95% CI: -15.04, -4.12, P=0.0006), first bowel movement (WMD -11.31, 95% CI: -21.05, -1.56, P=0.02), and the length of hospital stay (WMD -1.53, 95% CI: -2.08, -0.98, P<0.00001).

The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement.\n\nTrial registration: PROSPERO CRD42022330223.\n\nResults: Fourteen trials involving 1433 adult patients who undergo elective surgery were pooled in this meta-analysis. The results showed that preoperative chewing gum group resulted in no significant difference in gastric pH (p = .13) and gastric fluid volume (p = .25) compared with non-gum-chewing group. In comparison with the non-gum-chewing group, the gum-chewing group was associated with shorter preoperative thirst score (p = .02), lower incidence of postoperative nausea (p = .0004), lower incidence of postoperative sore throat, lower incidence of postoperative hoarseness, lower postoperative pain score, shorter first postoperative anal exhaust time (p < .00001), shorter first postoperative defecation time (p < .00001) and shorter hospital days (p = .02).\n\nConclusions: Preoperative chewing gum was associated with lower discomforts and complication rates, without increasing gastric pH and gastric fluid volume.

COMPLICATION: Chewing gum can inhibit the growth of oral bacteria, cleanse, and lubricate the oral cavity, which can help reduce postoperative sore throat. We hypothesize that chewing gum before surgery could relieve POST. METHODS: Patients planned to undergo total thyroidectomy under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomized to swallow saliva twice or chew 1.4 g/2.8 g of gum for 2 minutes before surgery. A standard anesthesia protocol was performed. The numerical rating scale scores of POST at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate/severe POST (numerical rating scale score >3) within 48 h. RESULTS: Data from 148 patients (control group, n = 50; 1.4 g group, n = 48; and 2.8 g group, n = 50) were included in the analysis. Within 48 h, there was a significant difference among the three groups in the incidence of moderate/severe POST (control group: 74% vs. 1.4 g group: 65% vs. 2.8 g group: 50%. P = 0.04). The 2.8 g group had less incidence of moderate/severe POST than the control group (Odds Ratio = 0.351 95% Confidence Interval: (0.152 and 0.814) P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Chewing 2.8 g gum before total thyroidectomy can reduce the incidence of moderate/severe POST within 48 h after surgery.","Comments":"2024-02-07","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zou S; Guo L; Xu C; Liu T; Li L; Pan S; Qi D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/wjs.12025","Keywords":"chewing gum\r\ncontrolled study\r\nendotracheal intubation\r\ngeneral anesthesia\r\nhuman\r\npharyngitis\r\npostoperative complication\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nthyroidectomy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zou S, Guo L, Xu C, Liu T, Li L, Pan S, and Qi D (2024) Effect of chewing gum of different weights before surgery on sore throat after total thyroidectomy: A randomized controlled trial.
